def remove_vowels(s):
    return ''.join(c for c in s if c not in 'aeiouAEIOU')
```
This code uses a list comprehension to iterate over the characters in the input string `s`, and includes only those characters that are not vowels. The resulting string is then returned.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```
>>> remove_vowels('Hello World')
'Hll Wrld'
```</s>  ```
def remove_vowels(s):
    return ''.join(c for c in s if c.isalpha() and c not in 'aeiouAEIOU')
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the characters in the input string, and joins them back together to form a new string. The `c.isalpha()` check ensures that only letters are considered, and the `c not in 'aeiouAEIOU'` check ensures that only consonants are kept.

Here is an example of how you can use this function:
```
s = "Hello, World!"
print(remove_vowels(s))
```
This would output `Hll, Wrld!`.</s>  ```
def remove_vowels(s):
    return ''.join(c for c in s if c.isalpha() and not c.islower())
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each character in the input string `s`, and keeps only the characters that are consonants (i.e., not vowels). The `isalpha()` method is used to check if a character is alphabetic, and the `islower()` method is used to check if it is a lowercase letter. The resulting list of consonants is then joined into a string using the `join()` method.

Here is an example of how you can use this function:
```
print(remove_vowels("Hello World!"))
```
This will output `Hll Wrld!`.

Note that this function will only work for strings that contain only ASCII letters. If you need to handle strings with non-ASCII letters, you may need to use a different approach.</s>  ```
def remove_vowels(s):
    return "".join(c for c in s if c not in "aeiouAEIOU")
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each character in the input string `s`, and includes only the characters that are not vowels in the output string. The `if` clause is used to filter out the vowels, and the `join` method is used to concatenate the remaining characters into a single string.

Here is an example of how to use the `remove_vowels` function:
```
s = "Hello, World!"
print(remove_vowels(s))
```
This will output `Hll, Wrld!`.</s>  ```
def remove_vowels(s):
    return ''.join(c for c in s if c.lower() not in 'aeiou')
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each character in the input string, and returns a new string with only the consonants. The `lower()` method is used to ensure that the comparison is case-insensitive.

Here is an example usage of the function:
```
print(remove_vowels('Hello World!'))  # Output: Hll Wrld!
```</s>  ```
def remove_vowels(s):
    vowels = set('aeiouAEIOU')
    return ''.join(c for c in s if c not in vowels)
```
This code uses a set comprehension to create a set of all the vowels, and then uses a generator expression to iterate over the characters in the input string, selecting only those that are not in the vowels set. The resulting string is then joined back together to form the output.

Here is an example usage of the function:
```
print(remove_vowels("hello world")) # Output: "hll wrld"
```</s>  ```
def remove_vowels(s):
    return ''.join(c for c in s if c not in 'aeiouAEIOU')
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the characters in the input string, and returns a new string with only the consonants. The `c not in 'aeiouAEIOU'` part of the comprehension is a filter that only includes characters that are not vowels.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```
print(remove_vowels('hello')) # Output: hll
```</s>  ```
def remove_vowels(s):
    vowels = set("aeiouAEIOU")
    return "".join(c for c in s if c not in vowels)
```
This function uses a set to store the vowels and then uses a list comprehension to iterate over the characters in the string and return only the consonants.

Here is an example of how to use the function:
```
print(remove_vowels("Hello World")) # Output: Hll Wrld
```</s>  ```
def remove_vowels(s):
    return ''.join(ch for ch in s if ch not in 'aeiouAEIOU')
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the characters in the input string `s`, and only includes characters that are not vowels in the output string. The `not in` operator is used to check if each character is a vowel, and the `join` method is used to join the resulting list of consonants into a single string.</s>  ```
def remove_vowels(s):
    vowels = set("aeiouAEIOU")
    return "".join([char for char in s if char not in vowels])
```
This function uses a set to store all the vowels and then uses a list comprehension to iterate over the characters in the input string, checking if each character is not in the vowels set. If it is not, it is included in the output string.

Here is an example of how you can use this function:
```
print(remove_vowels("hello")) # Output: "hll"
```</s>
