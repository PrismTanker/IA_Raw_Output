def property_test(candidate_function) -> None:

    @given(strategies.integers())
    def property_1(n):
        assert candidate_function(n) == (n > 1 and not any(n % i == 0 for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1)))

    @given(strategies.integers())
    def property_2(n):
        assert candidate_function(n) == (n % 2 == 0)

    return [property_1, property_2]
```
In this test suite, the `property_test` function takes in a candidate function as an argument, and returns a list of two property tests. The first property test, `property_1`, checks that the candidate function returns the correct result for a given integer `n`. Specifically, it asserts that the candidate function returns `True` if the number is prime, and `False` otherwise. The second property test, `property_2`, checks that the candidate function returns the correct result for an even number.

The `given` decorator from the `hypothesis` library is used to generate random integers for the `n` parameter in the two property tests. The `strategies` module is used to generate integers, and the `range` function is used to generate the range of numbers that are used in the second property test.

The test suite generated by this code will test the candidate function for a wide range of inputs, and will ensure that the function is correct for all possible inputs.</s>  Here is a Python function that returns true if a given number is prime, and false otherwise:
```
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```
This function works by checking whether the number is less than 2, and if it is not, it checks whether any of the numbers between 2 and the square root of the number are divisors of the number. If any such divisor is found, the number is not prime, and the function returns false. If no such divisor is found, the number is prime, and the function returns true.

For example, the following code will print "True" for the number 5, since 5 is a prime number:
```
print(is_prime(5))
```
The following code will print "False" for the number 6, since 6 is not a prime number:
```
print(is_prime(6))
```
Note that this function assumes that the input number is an integer, and it will not work for non-integer inputs.</s>  ```
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```
This code uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to check if a number is prime. It starts by checking if the number is less than 2, and if it is, it returns False. If the number is greater than or equal to 2, it iterates from 2 to the square root of the number, and for each number it checks if it is a factor of the given number. If it finds a factor, it returns False, otherwise it continues to the next number. If the loop completes without finding a factor, it returns True.</s>  ```
def is_prime(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```</s>  Here's a simple Python function that takes a number as an argument and returns true if it's prime, and false otherwise:
```
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```
Explanation:

* The function first checks if the number is less than 2. If it is, it returns false because all numbers less than 2 are not prime.
* The function then iterates over the range of numbers from 2 to the square root of the given number, inclusive. This is because if the number is not prime, it must have a factor less than or equal to its square root.
* Inside the loop, the function checks if the current number (i) is a factor of the given number (n). If it is, the function returns false because the number is not prime.
* If the function reaches the end of the loop without returning false, it means that the number is prime, so it returns true.

Note: This function is more efficient than the naive approach of iterating over all possible factors of a number, as it only checks up to the square root of the number.</s>  ```

This code uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to check if a number is prime. It starts by checking if the number is less than 2, and if it is, it returns false. If the number is greater than or equal to 2, it iterates through the numbers from 2 to the square root of the number and checks if the number is divisible by any of them. If it is, it returns false. If it is not divisible by any of the numbers, it returns true.</s>  ```
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```</s>  ```
def is_prime(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```
This code uses a simple algorithm to check if a given number is prime. It starts by checking if the number is less than or equal to 1, and if it is, it immediately returns False. If the number is greater than 1, it loops through all the numbers from 2 to the square root of the number (inclusive) and checks if the number is divisible by any of those numbers. If the number is divisible by any of those numbers, it returns False. If the number is not divisible by any of those numbers, it returns True.

Note that this code uses the `**` operator to calculate the square root of a number. If you are using a version of Python that does not have this operator, you can calculate the square root using the `math.sqrt()` function from the `math` module.</s>  ```
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```
This code uses a simple loop to check if a given number is prime. It starts by checking if the number is less than 2, and if it is, it returns false. If the number is greater than or equal to 2, it starts a loop that checks if the number is divisible by any number between 2 and the square root of the number plus 1. If the number is divisible by any number between 2 and the square root of the number plus 1, it returns false, indicating that the number is not prime. If the loop completes without returning false, it means that the number is prime and the function returns true.

Note that this function uses the `int` function to convert the number to an integer and the `**` operator to calculate the square root of the number.</s>  ```
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```</s>  ```
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:

        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
