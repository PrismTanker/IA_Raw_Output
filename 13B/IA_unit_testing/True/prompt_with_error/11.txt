def binary_or(a, b):
    return bin(int(a, 2) | int(b, 2))[2:]
```
This function takes two binary strings as input and performs a binary OR operation on them. It then returns the result as a binary string.

Here's an example usage:
```
print(binary_or("1100", "1010"))  # Output: "1110"
```</s>  ```
import numpy as np

def binary_or(a, b):
    return np.binary_repr(int(a, 2) | int(b, 2))
```
This code uses the `numpy` module to convert the input strings to integers, perform the binary OR operation, and then convert the result back to a string using the `numpy.binary_repr()` function.

Here's an example of how the code can be used:
```
a = "1010"
b = "0101"
print(binary_or(a, b))  # prints "1111"
```</s>  ```
def binary_or(a, b):
    return ''.join(str(int(x) | int(y)) for x, y in zip(a, b))
```
This code uses the built-in `zip` function to iterate over the two strings simultaneously, and the `|` operator to perform the binary OR operation on each pair of corresponding characters. The result is then converted to a string and returned.

Note that this function assumes that the input strings consist only of `1`s and `0`s, and will raise a `ValueError` if they contain any other characters. If you need to handle input strings that may contain other characters, you can modify the function accordingly.

Also, note that this function assumes that the two input strings have the same length. If they have different lengths, the result will be padded with `0`s to make them the same length before the OR operation is performed.

For example:
```
>>> binary_or('1010', '0101')
'1111'
```</s>  ```
import binascii

def binary_or(a, b):
    return binascii.b2a_hex(int(a, 2) | int(b, 2)).decode()

assert binary_or("1010", "0101") == "1111"
assert binary_or("1111", "1111") == "1111"
assert binary_or("0000", "0000") == "0000"
assert binary_or("1010", "0101") == "1111"
```</s>  ```
def binary_or(a, b):
    return "".join(str(int(i) | int(j)) for i, j in zip(a, b))
```
This function takes two strings `a` and `b` as input, where each string consists only of 1s and 0s. It performs the binary OR operation on these inputs using the bitwise OR operator `|` and returns the result as a string.

The `zip` function is used to iterate over the two strings simultaneously, and the `int` function is used to convert the characters in the strings to integers. The `str` function is used to convert the resulting integers back to strings. The `|` operator is used to perform the binary OR operation on each pair of integers, and the resulting strings are joined together to form the final output.

Here is an example of how the function can be used:
```
print(binary_or("1010", "0101"))  # Output: "1111"
```</s>  ```
def binary_or(a, b):
    return bin(int(a, 2) | int(b, 2))[2:]
```
This code uses the `int` function to convert the input strings to integers, and the `|` operator to perform the binary OR operation. The result is then converted back to a string using `bin` and the `[2:]` slice to remove the leading `0b` prefix.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```
print(binary_or('1010', '0101'))  # Output: '1111'
```
This function can be used with any length of input strings, and will produce the correct result as long as the strings only contain 1s and 0s.</s>  ```
def binary_or(a, b):
    return bin(int(a, 2) | int(b, 2))[2:]
```
This function takes two binary strings as input and performs a bitwise OR operation on them. The `int(a, 2)` and `int(b, 2)` lines convert the strings to integers in base 2, and the `|` operator performs the bitwise OR operation. The resulting integer is then converted back to a binary string using the `bin()` function. The `[2:]` slice is used to remove the leading `0b` prefix that is added by `bin()`.

Here is an example usage of the function:
```
print(binary_or("1010", "0101"))
# Output: '1111'
```</s>  ```
def binary_or(a, b):
    return "".join(str(int(x) | int(y)) for x, y in zip(a, b))
```
This code uses the built-in `zip()` function to iterate over the characters of `a` and `b` in parallel, and the bitwise OR operator `|` to perform the binary OR operation on each pair of characters. The result is then converted to a string and returned.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```
print(binary_or("1010", "0101")) # Output: "1111"
```
Note that this function assumes that the input strings `a` and `b` are of equal length, and contain only the characters `'0'` and `'1'`. If the inputs are not valid, the function will raise a `ValueError`.</s>  ```
def binary_or(a, b):
    return "".join(str(int(x) | int(y)) for x, y in zip(a, b))
```
This code uses the `zip()` function to iterate over the two strings simultaneously, and the bitwise OR operator `|` to perform the binary OR operation on each pair of bits. The result is then converted to a string using the `str()` function. The resulting string is returned.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```
>>> binary_or("1010", "0101")
'1111'
```
Note that this function assumes that the input strings are valid binary strings, meaning that they consist only of the characters '0' and '1'. If the input strings contain any other characters, the behavior of the function is undefined.</s>  ```
def binary_or(a, b):
    return bin(int(a, 2) | int(b, 2))[2:]
```
This function takes in two binary strings as input and returns the result of a bitwise OR operation between them. The `int(a, 2)` and `int(b, 2)` convert the binary strings to integers, and the `|` operator performs the bitwise OR operation. The `bin()` function then converts the result back to a binary string, and the `[2:]` slice removes the leading "0b" prefix.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```
>>> binary_or("1010", "0101")
'1111'
```</s>
