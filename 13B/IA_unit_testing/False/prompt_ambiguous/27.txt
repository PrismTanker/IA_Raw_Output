This test suite covers the following scenarios:

* A string with only lowercase letters
* An empty string
* A string with a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters
* A string with special characters
* A string with Unicode characters

Each test case consists of an input and an expected output. The input is a JSON object with a single key-value pair, where the key is "string" and the value is the input string. The expected output is a JSON object with a single key-value pair, where the key is "out" and the value is the expected output string.

Note that the expected output for the "swap_case" test case is "HELLO WORLD", which is the result of swapping the case of the letters in the input string "hello world". The expected output for the "swap_case_empty_string" test case is an empty string, since there are no characters in the input string to swap. The expected output for the "swap_case_special_chars" test case is the same as the input string, since special characters are not affected by the swap case operation. The expected output for the "swap_case_unicode_chars" test case is the same as the input string, since Unicode characters are not affected by the swap case operation.</s>  ```
def swap_case(s):
    return ''.join([c.lower() if c.isupper() else c.upper() for c in s])
```
This function takes a string `s` as input and returns a new string with the case of each character swapped. It uses a list comprehension to iterate over each character in the string, and uses the `isupper()` method to check if each character is uppercase. If a character is uppercase, it is converted to lowercase using `lower()`, otherwise it is converted to uppercase using `upper()`. Finally, the list comprehension is joined using the `join()` method to form a new string.

Here are some examples of how this function can be used:
```
print(swap_case("Hello World")) # Output: hELLO wORLD
print(swap_case("HELLO WORLD")) # Output: hello WORLD
print(swap_case("")) # Output: ""
```
This function can also be used with other string operations, such as concatenation:
```
s = "Hello"
s = s + swap_case(s) # Output: "HelloHELLO"
```
Note that this function will not modify the original string, it will return a new string with the swapped case.</s>  ```
def swap_case(s):
    return ''.join(c.lower() if c.isupper() else c.upper() for c in s)
```
This code uses a list comprehension to iterate over each character in the input string `s`, and applies the `.lower()` or `.upper()` method depending on whether the character is uppercase or lowercase. The resulting characters are then joined together using the empty string and returned as the result.

This code passes the test cases provided in the problem statement:
```
assert swap_case('hello') == 'HELLO'
assert swap_case('HELLO') == 'hello'
assert swap_case('') == ''
assert swap_case('12345') == '12345'
```</s>  ```
def swap_case(s):
    return ''.join([c.lower() if c.isupper() else c.upper() for c in s])
```
This function takes a string `s` and returns a new string with the case of each character swapped. The `join` method is used to combine the characters of the string, and the list comprehension is used to iterate over the characters of the string and apply the `lower` or `upper` method to each character based on its case.

Here is an example of how to use the function:
```
s = "Hello, World!"
print(swap_case(s)) # Output: "hELLO, wORLD!"
```
Note that this function only swaps the case of characters in the string, and does not modify the string in any other way. If you want to modify the string in place, you can use the `swapcase` method of the `str` class:
```
s = "Hello, World!"
s.swapcase()
print(s) # Output: "hELLO, wORLD!"
```</s>  ```
def swap_case(s):
    return ''.join(c.lower() if c.isupper() else c.upper() for c in s)
```
This function takes a string `s` as input and returns a new string with the case of all characters swapped. It uses a list comprehension to iterate over the characters in the string and apply the `lower()` or `upper()` method as appropriate.

Here is an example of how to use this function:
```
print(swap_case("Hello World")) # Output: hELLO wORLD
```
This function is robust and handles all cases, including strings with mixed case and strings with special characters.

Note: This function uses the `isupper()` and `islower()` methods to determine if a character is upper or lower case. These methods are available in the `string` module, which is included in the standard Python distribution.</s>  ```
def swap_case(s):
    return ''.join(c.lower() if c.isupper() else c.upper() for c in s)
```
This code uses a list comprehension to iterate over each character in the string `s`, and applies the `lower()` or `upper()` method to each character based on whether it is uppercase or lowercase, respectively. The resulting list of characters is then joined into a new string using the `join()` method.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```
print(swap_case("Hello World"))  # prints "hELLO wORLD"
```</s>  ```
def swap_case(s):
    return ''.join(c.lower() if c.isupper() else c.upper() for c in s)
```
This code defines a function `swap_case` that takes a string `s` as input and returns a new string with the case of all characters swapped. The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each character in the input string `s`, and for each character, it applies the `.lower()` method if the character is uppercase and the `.upper()` method if the character is lowercase. The resulting string is then joined together using the `''.join()` method to form the final output.

For example, if the input string is `"Hello World"`, the output string will be `"hELLO wORLD"`.</s>  ```
def swap_case(s):
    return ''.join(c.lower() if c.isupper() else c.upper() for c in s)
```
This code uses the `str.isupper()` method to check if a character is uppercase, and the `str.lower()` and `str.upper()` methods to convert a character to lowercase or uppercase, respectively. The `join()` method is used to combine the modified characters into a new string.

Test cases:
```
assert swap_case('hello') == 'HELLO'
assert swap_case('HELLO') == 'hello'
assert swap_case('hElLo') == 'HeLlO'
```
Note: This code assumes that the input string only contains ASCII characters. If the input string contains non-ASCII characters, you may need to use a different approach to swap the case.</s>  ```
def swap_case(s):
    return "".join(c.lower() if c.isupper() else c.upper() for c in s)
```
This function takes a string `s` as input and returns a new string with the case of all the characters swapped. The `join()` method is used to concatenate the characters of the string, and the `c.lower()` and `c.upper()` methods are used to convert the characters to lowercase and uppercase, respectively. The `isupper()` method is used to check if a character is uppercase.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```
>>> swap_case("Hello, World!")
'hELLO, wORLD!'
```
This function can also be used to swap the case of a single character:
```
>>> swap_case("a")
'A'
```
Note that this function will only swap the case of ASCII characters, and will not work for characters outside the ASCII range.</s>  ```
def swap_case(s):
    return ''.join(c.lower() if c.isupper() else c.upper() for c in s)
```
Here's an example usage:
```
print(swap_case("Hello World")) # Output: hELLO wORLD
```
This code uses the `str.isupper()` method to check if a character is uppercase, and the `str.lower()` and `str.upper()` methods to convert the case of the character. The `str.join()` method is used to join the modified characters back into a string.</s>  ```
def swap_case(string):
    return string.swapcase()
```
This function takes a string as input and returns a string with the case of each character swapped. The `swapcase()` method is used to swap the case of each character in the string.

For example, if we call the function with the string "Hello World", it will return "hELLO wORLD".

Note that this function only works for ASCII characters and will not work for characters outside of the ASCII range.

Also, this function is case-sensitive, so if the input string contains uppercase and lowercase characters, the output string will also contain both uppercase and lowercase characters.

Here is an example usage of the function:
```
print(swap_case("Hello World")) # Output: hELLO wORLD
print(swap_case("hello world")) # Output: HEllo WoRLD
```
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.</s>
