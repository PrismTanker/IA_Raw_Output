def triangle_area(base, height):
    return (base * height) / 2
```
This code defines a function `triangle_area` that takes two arguments: `base` and `height`. It returns the area of the triangle using the formula `area = (base * height) / 2`.

To use this function, you can call it with the desired values for `base` and `height`, like this:
```
print(triangle_area(5, 3))
```
This will print the area of the triangle with a base of 5 and a height of 3, which is 7.5.

Note that the formula for the area of a triangle is `area = (base * height) / 2`, and this code uses this formula to calculate the area of the triangle.</s>  ```

def triangle_area(base, height):
    return 0.5 * base * height
```</s>  ```
import math
def triangle_area(length, height):
    return (length * height) / 2
    ```

Explanation:

The formula for the area of a triangle is:

Area = (base \* height) / 2

In this case, the base of the triangle is the length of the side and the height is the height of the triangle.

The function `triangle_area` takes in the length and height of the triangle as arguments and returns the area of the triangle.

The `import math` statement is used to import the `math` module, which is used to perform mathematical operations such as multiplication and division.

The `/ 2` at the end of the formula is used to calculate the area of the triangle.

The `return` statement is used to return the calculated area of the triangle.</s>  ```
import math

def triangle_area(base, height):
    return (base * height) / 2
```
This code uses the `math` module to calculate the area of a triangle given the base and height of the triangle. The function `triangle_area` takes in two arguments, `base` and `height`, and returns the area of the triangle using the formula `base * height / 2`. The formula is wrapped in parentheses and divided by 2 to get the area of the triangle.</s>  ```
    def triangle_area(side, height):
        return 0.5 * side * height
    ```

This code defines a function `triangle_area` that takes two arguments `side` and `height`. It returns the area of a triangle with the given side and height. The formula for the area of a triangle is `0.5 * side * height`.

Here's a test case to demonstrate how the function can be used:
```
print(triangle_area(5, 3))
```
This will output `7.5`, which is the area of a triangle with a side of 5 and a height of 3.</s>  ```
import math

def triangle_area(base, height):
    return (base * height) / 2
    ```</s>  ```
import math

def triangle_area(base, height):
    return (base * height) / 2

print(triangle_area(5, 3))
```
This code defines a function `triangle_area` that takes two arguments, `base` and `height`, and returns the area of a triangle with those dimensions. The function uses the formula for the area of a triangle, which is `A = (base * height) / 2`, to calculate the area and return it. The function is then called with the arguments `5` and `3` and the result is printed to the console.</s>  ```
import math

def triangle_area(side, height):
    return 0.5 * side * height
    ```
This code uses the `math` module to calculate the area of a triangle, given the length of one side and the height. The formula for the area of a triangle is:

Area = 0.5 \* side \* height

The function takes in two parameters, `side` and `height`, and returns the area of the triangle. The formula is used to calculate the area and return it as a float.</s>  ```
import math

def triangle_area(base, height):
    return 0.5 * base * height
```
This code uses the `math` module to calculate the area of a triangle given the base and height. The formula for the area of a triangle is `0.5 * base * height`, so we use this formula to calculate the area and return it.

Note that this function assumes that the base and height are both positive numbers. If you need to handle cases where the base or height is negative, you can add additional checks in the function.</s>  ```
def triangle_area(base, height):
    return (base * height) / 2
```</s>
