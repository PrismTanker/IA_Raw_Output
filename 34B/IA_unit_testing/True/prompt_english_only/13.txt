```
This test suite includes a variety of test cases, including positive and negative integers, and tests for both the greatest common divisor of two positive integers and the greatest common divisor of a positive integer and a negative integer.</s>  ```
def gcd(a, b):
    while b != 0:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a
```
This function uses the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor of two integers. It works by repeatedly dividing the larger number by the smaller number until the remainder is 0, at which point the smaller number is the GCD.

Here is an example of how to use this function:
```
print(gcd(12, 15)) # prints 3
print(gcd(12, 18)) # prints 6
print(gcd(12, 24)) # prints 12
```
This function is efficient and will work for any two integers.</s>  ```
def gcd(a, b):
    while b != 0:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a
```
This function uses the Euclidean algorithm to calculate the greatest common divisor of two integers. It starts by setting `a` and `b` to the input values, then repeatedly subtracts the smaller number from the larger number until the smaller number is 0. The remaining value in `a` is then the greatest common divisor.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```
print(gcd(12, 15)) # prints 3
```</s>  ```
def gcd(a, b):
    while b != 0:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a
```
Explanation:

The GCD of two integers `a` and `b` can be computed using the Euclidean algorithm. The algorithm works by repeatedly subtracting the smaller number from the larger number until the smaller number is 0. The remaining number is the GCD.

In Python, we can implement this algorithm using a while loop. We first initialize the variables `a` and `b` to the two integers we want to find the GCD of. Then, we enter a loop where we subtract `b` from `a` and assign the result to `a`. We then check if `b` is 0, and if it is, we return `a`. Otherwise, we assign `b` to `a` and repeat the process.

For example, if we want to find the GCD of 12 and 15, we can use the following code:
```
>>> gcd(12, 15)
3
```
This will return 3, which is the greatest common divisor of 12 and 15.</s>  ```
def gcd(a, b):
    while b != 0:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a
```
This function uses the Euclidean algorithm to calculate the greatest common divisor of two integers. It works by iteratively dividing the larger number by the smaller number until the smaller number is 0, at which point the larger number is the GCD.

Here is an example of how this function would work for the inputs 12 and 15:
```
>>> gcd(12, 15)
3
```
This output indicates that the GCD of 12 and 15 is 3.</s>  ```
def gcd(a, b):
    while b != 0:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a
```
This function uses the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor of two integers. It works by repeatedly subtracting the smaller number from the larger number until the smaller number is 0, at which point the remaining number is the greatest common divisor.

Here's an example of how to use this function:
```
print(gcd(12, 15)) # prints 3
print(gcd(24, 30)) # prints 6
```
This function is efficient and works for all positive integers.</s>  ```
def gcd(a, b):
    while b != 0:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a
```
This function uses the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor of two integers. It works by repeatedly subtracting the smaller number from the larger number until the smaller number is 0, at which point the remaining number is the greatest common divisor.</s>  ```
def gcd(a, b):
    while b != 0:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a
```
This function uses the Euclidean algorithm to calculate the greatest common divisor of two integers. It works by repeatedly dividing the larger number by the smaller number until the remainder is 0, at which point the smaller number is the greatest common divisor.

Here's an example of how to use this function:
```
print(gcd(12, 15)) # Output: 3
print(gcd(12, 18)) # Output: 6
print(gcd(12, 24)) # Output: 12
```</s>  ```
def gcd(a, b):
    while b != 0:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a
```
This code uses the Euclidean algorithm to calculate the greatest common divisor of two integers. It works by repeatedly subtracting the smaller number from the larger number until the smaller number is 0, at which point the remaining number is the greatest common divisor.

Here is an example of how this code works:
```
gcd(12, 15)
# 3
```
In this example, the function first calculates `15 % 12`, which is 3. Then it calculates `12 % 3`, which is 0. Therefore, the greatest common divisor of 12 and 15 is 3.

This code passes the test cases because it correctly calculates the greatest common divisor for a variety of inputs. For example, it correctly calculates the greatest common divisor of 12 and 15, which is 3. It also correctly calculates the greatest common divisor of 6 and 8, which is 2.</s>  ```
def gcd(a, b):
    while b != 0:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a
```</s>  ```
def gcd(a, b):
    while b != 0:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a
```
This function uses the Euclidean algorithm to calculate the greatest common divisor of two integers. It starts by setting `a` and `b` to their respective values, then enters a loop where it repeatedly sets `a` to `b` and `b` to the remainder of `a` divided by `b` until `b` is equal to 0. Once `b` is 0, the function returns the value of `a`, which is the greatest common divisor of the original `a` and `b`.

Here is an example of how to use this function:
```
print(gcd(12, 15))  # Output: 3
print(gcd(10, 15))  # Output: 5
print(gcd(12, 18))  # Output: 6
```
This function has a time complexity of O(log(min(a, b))), which is optimal for calculating the GCD of two integers.</s>
