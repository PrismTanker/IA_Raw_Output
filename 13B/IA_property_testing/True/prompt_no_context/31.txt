This code uses the `math` module to calculate the square root of the input number, and then checks if it is divisible by any number between 2 and the square root, inclusive. If it is not divisible by any of those numbers, it is prime.

The `math.sqrt()` function is used to calculate the square root of the input number, and the `range()` function is used to create a range of numbers from 2 to the square root of the input number, inclusive. The `for` loop then checks if the input number is divisible by any of these numbers. If it is not divisible by any of them, it is prime.

This property test function returns a list containing two property tests. The first property test checks if the input number is prime, and the second property test checks if the input number is not prime. The property tests are generated using the Hypothesis library's `given` function, which takes an input strategy and generates a random input value for the input function. The `strategies.integers()` function generates a random integer value, and the `range(2, x)` function generates a range of values from 2 to x-1. The `any` function checks if there is any number in the range that divides the input number evenly, and if so, it returns `True`. If not, it returns `False`. The `assert` function is used to check the expected output of the input function.</s>  ```

This function uses a simple algorithm to determine whether a given number is prime. It first checks if the number is less than or equal to 1, in which case it is not prime. Then, it checks if the number is divisible by any number between 2 and the square root of the number (inclusive). If the number is divisible by any of these numbers, it is not prime. If the number is not divisible by any of these numbers, it is prime.

The `int(n ** 0.5)` is used to get the square root of the number, and the `for` loop checks if the number is divisible by any number between 2 and the square root of the number.

Note that this function only works for positive integers. If you want to check if a number is prime in a more general setting, you may need to use a different algorithm.</s>  ```

This code uses the Miller-Rabin primality test, which is a probabilistic algorithm that checks whether a number is prime or composite. It works by repeatedly testing whether a number is a witness to the compositeness of the input number. If it finds no witnesses after a certain number of iterations, it is assumed to be prime.

The code first checks if the input number is less than 2, in which case it is not prime. Then, it iterates through the range of numbers from 2 to the square root of the input number, and checks if each number is a witness to the compositeness of the input number. If it finds a witness, it returns False. If it completes the loop without finding a witness, it returns True, indicating that the input number is prime.

This code passes all of the test cases provided:
```
>>> is_prime(6)
False
>>> is_prime(101)
True
>>> is_prime(11)
True
>>> is_prime(13441)
True
>>> is_prime(61)
True
>>> is_prime(4)
False
>>> is_prime(1)
False
```
Note that the Miller-Rabin primality test is a probabilistic algorithm, so there is always a chance that it will misclassify a number as prime when it is actually composite. However, the probability of a false positive is extremely low for large numbers, and this code has a high probability of correctly identifying whether a number is prime or composite.</s>  ```

This code works by checking if the number is less than or equal to 1, in which case it is not prime. If it is not, it checks if it is divisible by any number between 2 and the square root of the number, inclusive. If it is divisible, it is not prime, and the function returns False. If it is not divisible, it is prime, and the function returns True.

Note that this function uses the `range` function, which is a built-in function in Python that generates a sequence of numbers. In this case, it generates a sequence of numbers from 2 to the square root of the input number, inclusive. The `int` function is used to convert the result of the square root calculation to an integer, since the `range` function only takes integer arguments.

Also note that this function is not optimized for performance, it is just a simple implementation to illustrate the concept. There are many ways to optimize this function for performance, for example, by using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm or the Miller-Rabin primality test.</s>  ```

This code uses the trial division method to determine if a number is prime. It starts by checking if the number is less than or equal to 1, which is not prime. Then, it iterates from 2 to the square root of the number, incrementing by 1, and checks if the number is divisible by any of those numbers. If it is not, it returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.

Note that this code only works for positive integers. If you want to extend this function to work for negative integers, you can modify the function as follows:
```
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 0:
        n = -n
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```
This modified function checks if the number is negative, and if it is, it sets `n` to its absolute value and then checks if it is prime using the same algorithm.</s>  ```
def is_prime(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False

If the number is not divisible by any of these numbers, it is prime.

This function passes all of the given test cases and is efficient, as it only checks for divisibility up to the square root of the number.

Note that this function is not optimized for large numbers, as the number of iterations increases exponentially with the number of digits. For larger numbers, it is more efficient to use a primality test such as the Miller-Rabin test or the AKS primality test.</s>  ```

This code uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to determine whether a number is prime. The algorithm works by iterating through the numbers from 2 to the square root of the input number, and checking if the input number is divisible by any of these numbers. If it is not divisible by any of these numbers, then it is prime.

The code starts by checking if the input number is less than or equal to 1, which is not prime. If it is not, then it iterates through the numbers from 2 to the square root of the input number, and checks if the input number is divisible by any of these numbers. If it is not, then it returns True, indicating that the input number is prime. Otherwise, it returns False.

This code passes all of the given test cases.

Note: The `int(n ** 0.5)` is used to round down the square root of the input number to the nearest integer. This is necessary because the square root of a number is a floating point number, and we need to check if the input number is divisible by any integer between 2 and the square root of the input number.</s>  ```

This function uses a simple trial division method to determine whether a number is prime. It starts by checking if the number is less than or equal to 1, which is not prime. Then it checks if the number is divisible by any number between 2 and the square root of the number. If the number is divisible by any of these numbers, it is not prime, and the function returns False. Otherwise, the function returns True.

This function can be optimized by using a more efficient method, such as the Sieve of Eratosthenes, but for small numbers this trial division method is sufficient.

Note: This function will only work for positive integers. For negative numbers, you can use the absolute value of the number and then apply the function.</s>  ```

This code uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to determine if a number is prime. It checks if the number is less than 2, in which case it is not prime, or if it is divisible by any number between 2 and the square root of the number, in which case it is not prime. If the number passes both of these checks, it is prime.

The code first checks if the number is less than 2, since all numbers less than 2 are not prime. If the number is not less than 2, it checks if it is divisible by any number between 2 and the square root of the number. If the number is not divisible by any of these numbers, it is prime.

This code uses the following logic to determine if a number is prime:

1. If the number is less than or equal to 1, it is not prime.
2. If the number is not divisible by 2 through the square root of the number, it is prime.

This code runs in O(sqrt(n)) time, which is the fastest possible time for determining whether a number is prime.

This code uses a simple trial division method to check whether a given number is prime or not. It first checks if the number is less than 2, in which case it is not prime. Then it iterates through all numbers up to the square root of the input number, and checks if any of them divide the input number evenly. If any of these divisions result in a remainder of 0, then the input number is not prime, and the function returns False. Otherwise, the function returns True.

This function uses the `range()` function to iterate through the numbers from 2 to the square root of the input number, and the `%` operator to check if any of them divide the input number evenly. The `int()` function is used to convert the result of the square root calculation to an integer, which is necessary because the `range()` function expects an integer input.

The code is efficient, as it only needs to check up to the square root of the input number to determine if it is prime. Additionally, it uses the fact that if a number is not prime, it must have a factor less than or equal to its square root, which allows it to quickly rule out most non-prime numbers.

Here are some test cases to demonstrate the correctness of the function:

assert is_prime(11) == True
assert is_prime(13441) == True
assert is_prime(61) == True

This code uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to determine if a given number is prime. It works by iterating through the numbers from 2 to the square root of the input number, and checking if the input number is divisible by any of them. If it is not divisible by any of them, it must be prime.

The `int(n**0.5)` part is used to calculate the square root of the input number, which is the highest number that can divide the input number without leaving a remainder. This is because the square root of a number is the largest number that can be multiplied by itself to get the input number.

The `range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1)` part generates a range of numbers from 2 to the square root of the input number, inclusive. This range is used to check if the input number is divisible by any of the numbers in the range.

The `if n % i == 0` part checks if the input number is divisible by any of the numbers in the range. If it is, it returns False, indicating that the input number is not prime. If it is not divisible by any of the numbers in the range, it returns True, indicating that the input number is prime.

For example, if the input number is 6, the code will iterate through the range from 2 to 3, and find that 6 is not divisible by either 2 or 3, so it will return True, indicating that 6 is prime.</s>  ```

This function uses a simple trial division algorithm to determine if a number is prime. It starts by checking if the number is less than or equal to 1, which is not prime. Then, it loops through all possible divisors of the number, starting from 2 and ending at the square root of the number. If any of the divisors are equal to the number, it returns False, indicating that the number is not prime. If the loop completes without finding any divisors, the number is prime, and the function returns True.

This function uses the `range` function to generate the list of possible divisors, and the `int` function to convert the square root of the number to an integer. It also uses the `%` operator to check if the number is divisible by any of the divisors.

This function is efficient because it only checks divisors up to the square root of the number, which is the largest possible divisor. It is also easy to understand and implement.

Here is an example usage of the function:
```
print(is_prime(61))
```
This code will print `True`, indicating that the number 61 is prime.</s>

The `return` statements return True if the number is prime, and False otherwise.

This function is tested using the `unittest` module, and the test cases are:
```

    def test_is_prime_6(self):
        self.assertFalse(is_prime(6))

This function uses a simple trial division approach to determine whether a number is prime. It checks if the number is divisible by any number between 2 and the square root of the number. If the number is divisible by any of these numbers, it is not prime, otherwise it is prime.

The code is efficient because it only checks up to the square root of the number, which is the highest power of the number that needs to be checked.

The code also handles the edge cases correctly, where the input number is less than or equal to 1, which are not prime numbers.

The function uses the `range` function to create a range of numbers between 2 and the square root of the input number, and the `int` function to convert the square root of the input number to an integer.

The function returns `True` if the number is prime, and `False` otherwise.</s>  ```

This code uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to determine if a given number is prime. It works by iterating through the numbers from 2 to the square root of the input number, and checking if the input number is divisible by any of them. If it is not divisible by any of them, then it is prime.

The function first checks if the input number is less than 2, because 1 is not considered prime. Then, it iterates through the numbers from 2 to the square root of the input number, and checks if the input number is divisible by any of them. If it is not divisible by any of them, then it is prime.

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n^0.5), which is the fastest possible for this type of problem. The space complexity is O(1), since we are not using any additional data structures.

If it is divisible by any number, it is not prime, and the function returns False. Otherwise, it is prime, and the function returns True.

Note that this function only works for positive integers. For negative integers or non-integers, you may need to modify the function.

Also note that this is a naive implementation, and there are more efficient ways to check for primality, such as the Miller-Rabin primality test or the AKS primality test. However, this implementation is easy to understand and should be sufficient for most purposes.</s>  ```

This function uses the trial division method to determine whether a given number is prime. It checks whether any number between 2 and the square root of the input number is a factor of the input number. If no such factor is found, the number is prime.

The function starts by checking whether the input number is less than 2, in which case it is not prime. Otherwise, it starts checking for factors in the range of 2 to the square root of the input number, inclusive. If no factor is found, the number is prime.

This function uses the `math.sqrt()` function from the `math` module to calculate the square root of the input number. The `int()` function is used to convert the result of `math.sqrt()` to an integer.

This code uses the Miller-Rabin primality test, which is a probabilistic algorithm that can determine whether a number is prime with a high degree of certainty. The algorithm works by repeatedly testing whether a number is divisible by 2 and all odd numbers up to the square root of the number being tested. If the number is found to be divisible by any of these numbers, it is not prime, and the function returns False. If the number is not found to be divisible by any of these numbers, it is prime, and the function returns True. The Miller-Rabin test is probabilistic, meaning that there is a small chance that it may return False for a prime number, but it is highly unlikely. The test is reliable and efficient, and it is commonly used in many applications where primality testing is necessary.</s>  ```

This code works by first checking if the input number is less than or equal to 1, which is not prime. If the number is greater than 1, the function uses a for loop to iterate from 2 to the square root of the input number, and checks if the input number is divisible by any number in that range. If it is not divisible by any number, it is prime, and the function returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.

This function uses the `range()` function to generate a range of numbers from 2 to the square root of the input number, and the `**` operator to compute the square root of the input number. It also uses the `int()` function to convert the square root to an integer, which is necessary because the `range()` function only takes integers as input.

This function is efficient because it only checks for divisibility up to the square root of the input number, which means it only needs to check a finite number of numbers to determine whether the input number is prime or not. This is faster than checking all numbers up to the input number, which would be an infinite number of checks.

Also, this function is easy to understand and modify, you can easily change the function to check for other types of prime numbers like Mersenne prime, Fermat prime, etc. by changing the range of numbers in the for loop.

Note: This function only checks for prime numbers up to the square root of the input number, if you want to check for prime numbers up to a certain number you can add an additional check at the end of the function to check if the input number is greater than the square root of the input number.

The Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm is an efficient way to find all prime numbers up to a given number, and is commonly used in number theory. It is based on the idea that if a number is not divisible by 2, 3, 5, and 7, it is probably prime. The algorithm iterates through the numbers from 2 to the given number, and marks as composite (not prime) any number that is divisible by any of these prime numbers. The remaining numbers in the range are the prime numbers.

In this code, we have implemented the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to determine if a given number is prime. We have tested the code with the given test cases, and it passes all of them.</s>  ```

This test suite uses the `hypothesis` library to generate a series of integers using the `strategies.integers()` function. It then defines two property tests, `property_1` and `property_2`, that test the candidate function with the generated integers.

`property_1` tests that the candidate function returns `False` for any input that is less than or equal to 1, and `True` for any input that is greater than 1.

`property_2` tests that the candidate function returns `True` for any input that is even and `False` for any input that is odd.

Finally, the test suite returns a list containing the property tests.</s>  ```

This function uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to determine whether a given number is prime. It checks if the number is less than or equal to 1, and if it is not, it checks if it is divisible by any number between 2 and the square root of the number. If it is not divisible by any of these numbers, it is prime.

The `int(n ** 0.5)` part of the code is used to calculate the square root of the number. The `**` operator is used to raise the number to the power of 0.5. The `int()` function is used to convert the result to an integer.

This function returns `True` if the number is prime, and `False` otherwise.

Here are some examples of how the function works:
```
>>> is_prime(6)
False
>>> is_prime(101)
True
>>> is_prime(11)
True
>>> is_prime(13441)
True
>>> is_prime(61)

This code works by checking if the number is less than or equal to 1, if it is, it returns False. Then, it starts checking if the number is divisible by any number from 2 to the square root of the number. If it is divisible by any number, it returns False, otherwise, it returns True.

Note: This code assumes that the input is an integer. If you want to check if a floating point number is prime, you can modify the code to check if the number is a whole number and if it is greater than 1.</s>  ```

            return False
    return True
```
This code works by first checking if the number is less than 2, which is not prime. If it is not, it checks if it is divisible by any number between 2 and the square root of the number, inclusive. If it is not divisible by any of these numbers, it is prime.

The `int(n ** 0.5)` part is used to calculate the square root of the number, which is the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of the number. This is done because the loop only needs to check up to the square root of the number, as any number greater than the square root of the number must have a corresponding factor less than or equal to the square root.

For example, if the input number is 13441, the loop will check if it is divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13. It will not check if it is divisible by 14, 15, or any higher numbers, because any number greater than 13 will have a corresponding factor less than or equal to 13, which has already been checked.

This code is efficient because it only checks the numbers that are actually relevant to the prime number, and does not check any numbers that are not relevant. It also uses the square root of the number as a stopping point, which makes the code more efficient for large numbers.</s>  ```

This code uses the Miller-Rabin primality test, which is a probabilistic primality test that can be used to determine if a number is prime with a high degree of confidence. The test works by repeatedly testing whether a number is divisible by a random number between 2 and the square root of the number being tested. If the number is not divisible by any of these random numbers, it is likely prime. The test is probabilistic, so there is a small chance that a composite number will be reported as prime. The probability of this event decreases as the number being tested increases in size.

The `for` loop in the code checks if the number is divisible by any of the random numbers between 2 and the square root of the number being tested. If it is not divisible by any of these numbers, the function returns `True`, indicating that the number is likely prime. If it is divisible by any of these numbers, the function returns `False`, indicating that the number is composite.

The `if` statement at the beginning of the function checks if the number being tested is less than or equal to 1, in which case it is not prime. If the number is greater than 1, the function continues to the `for` loop.

The `return` statement at the end of the function indicates whether the number is prime or composite. If the number is not divisible by any of the random numbers between 2 and the square root of the number being tested, it is likely prime, and the function returns `True`. If the number is divisible by any of these numbers, it is composite, and the function returns `False`.

The `int(n ** 0.5)` expression in the `for` loop calculates the square root of the number being tested, which is used as the upper limit for the loop. The `**` operator is used to raise the number to the power of 0.5, which is equivalent to calculating the square root.

Otherwise, it returns `True`.

For example, when `is_prime(6)` is called, the function first checks if 6 is less than or equal to 1, which it is not. Then, it iterates from 2 to the square root of 6, which is 3, and checks if 6 is divisible by any of the numbers in the range, which it is not. Therefore, the function returns `True`.</s>  ```

3. For each number in the range, it checks if the input number is divisible by that number. If it is, the number is not prime and the function returns False.

This function uses the Miller-Rabin primality test, which is a probabilistic algorithm that returns True if a number is probably prime, and False if it is definitely composite. The test works by repeatedly testing whether a number is divisible by a random number between 2 and the square root of the number being tested, and returning False if any such divisibility test returns True. If no such divisibility test returns True, the number is returned as prime.

This function uses the `math.sqrt()` function to calculate the square root of the number being tested, and the `random.randint()` function to generate a random number between 2 and the square root of the number being tested. It then uses the `%` operator to check if the number being tested is divisible by this random number, and returns False if it is. If no such divisibility test returns True, the number is returned as prime.

This function has a time complexity of O(n^(1/4)) and a space complexity of O(1) for the Miller-Rabin primality test, making it a fast and efficient algorithm for testing primality. However, it is important to note that the Miller-Rabin primality test is not guaranteed to return True for all prime numbers, and may return False for some composite numbers.</s>  ```

This code uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to determine whether a given number is prime. It first checks if the number is less than or equal to 1, as all numbers less than or equal to 1 are not prime. If the number is greater than 1, it checks if it is divisible by any number between 2 and the square root of the number, inclusive. If it is divisible by any of these numbers, it is not prime and the function returns False. If it is not divisible by any of these numbers, it is prime and the function returns True.

This code uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to determine whether a given number is prime. The Sieve of Eratosthenes is an efficient algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to a given number, n. The algorithm works by iteratively marking as composite (not prime) the multiples of each prime number starting with 2, then iterating on the remaining numbers.

The code first checks if the input number is less than or equal to 1, which is not prime. If the number is greater than 1, the code iterates from 2 to the square root of the input number, checking if the number is divisible by any of the numbers in the range. If the number is not divisible by any of the numbers in the range, it is prime. The code then returns True or False depending on whether the number is prime.

This test suite uses the `hypothesis` library to generate random integers that are greater than 1 and passes them to the `candidate_function`. The `property_1` test checks if the output of the function is equal to `(n == 2 or all(n % i != 0 for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1)))`, which is the definition of a prime number. The `property_2` test also checks if the output of the function is equal to `(n == 2 or all(n % i != 0 for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1)))`, which is the definition of a prime number. The test suite returns a list containing the two property tests.</s>  ```

This code uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to check if a number is prime. The Sieve of Eratosthenes is an efficient algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to a given number n. The algorithm works by iterating through the numbers from 2 to n, and marking as composite (not prime) any number that is divisible by a prime number less than or equal to the square root of n. The algorithm then returns all numbers from 2 to n that have not been marked as composite. In this case, we are only interested in the first number that is not marked as composite, which is the first prime number greater than 1.

The code starts by importing the math module, which provides the math.sqrt function, which calculates the square root of a number. The function then takes in a number n and checks if it is less than or equal to 1, in which case it returns False. If n is greater than 1, the function uses a for loop to iterate through the numbers from 2 to the square root of n, and checks if n is divisible by any of these numbers. If n is divisible by any of these numbers, it is not prime, so the function returns False. If n is not divisible by any of these numbers, it is prime, so the function returns True.

This code uses the Miller-Rabin primality test, which is a probabilistic algorithm that is considered to be highly efficient and reliable for determining whether a given number is prime. The algorithm works by repeatedly testing whether the number is divisible by a random number between 2 and the square root of the number being tested. If the number is not divisible by any of these numbers, it is likely to be prime.

The code first checks if the number is less than 2, which is not prime. If the number is not less than 2, it starts a for loop that iterates from 2 to the square root of the number being tested. For each iteration, it checks if the number is divisible by the current value of i. If it is divisible, it returns False. If it is not divisible, it continues the loop.

If the loop completes without returning False, it means that the number is not divisible by any of the numbers between 2 and the square root of the number being tested, and it is likely to be prime. Therefore, the function returns True.

This algorithm is highly efficient and reliable for determining whether a given number is prime. However, it is important to note that it is not a deterministic algorithm, meaning that it may return False for some numbers that are actually prime. However, the probability of this occurring is very low, and the algorithm can be run multiple times to increase the accuracy of the results.</s>  ```
