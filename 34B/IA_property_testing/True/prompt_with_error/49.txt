Prompt: Return 2^n modulo n (be aware of numerics).
-------------------
  Here is a test suite using the `hypothesis` library to test a function that returns 2^n modulo n:
```
from hypothesis import given, strategies

def property_test(candidate_function) -> None:
    @given(strategies.integers(min_value=1))
    def property_1(n):
        assert candidate_function(n) == 2**n % n

    @given(strategies.integers(min_value=1))
    def property_2(n):
        assert candidate_function(n) == 0

    return [property_1, property_2]
```
This test suite defines two properties to test:

1. `property_1`: For any positive integer `n`, `candidate_function(n)` should be equal to `2**n % n`.
2. `property_2`: For any positive integer `n`, `candidate_function(n)` should be equal to 0.

The `given` decorator is used to specify the range of values that the function should be tested with. In this case, we're testing with positive integers (i.e., `min_value=1`).

The `property_test` function takes a function `candidate_function` as input, and returns a list of property tests. The property tests are defined using the `given` decorator, and the `assert` statement is used to check that the expected result is returned.

To run this test suite, you would need to import the `hypothesis` library and call the `property_test` function with a candidate function that you want to test. For example:
```
from hypothesis import given, strategies

def test_candidate_function():
    property_test(candidate_function)
```
This will run the `property_test` function with the `candidate_function` and verify that it passes the two properties defined in the test suite.</s>  ```
def power_modulo(base, exponent, modulus):
    if modulus == 1:
        return 0
    result = 1
    base = base % modulus
    while exponent > 0:
        if exponent % 2 == 1:
            result = (result * base) % modulus
        exponent = exponent // 2
        base = (base * base) % modulus
    return result
```
This code uses the modular exponentiation algorithm to compute 2^n modulo n, where n is the modulus. It takes three arguments: the base (2), the exponent (n), and the modulus (n).

The code first checks if the modulus is 1, in which case the result is 0.

Then it initializes the result to 1, and reduces the base to its remainder when divided by the modulus.

Next, it iterates through the binary representation of the exponent, starting from the most significant bit. For each bit that is set, it multiplies the result by the base and takes the remainder when divided by the modulus.

Finally, it returns the result.

Note that this code assumes that the modulus is a positive integer. If the modulus can be negative, you may need to add additional logic to handle that case.</s>  ```
def power_mod(base, exponent, modulus):
    result = 1
    while exponent > 0:
        if exponent % 2 == 1:
            result = (result * base) % modulus
        base = (base * base) % modulus
        exponent //= 2
    return result
```
This function uses the modular exponentiation algorithm to compute the value of `base^exponent modulo modulus`. The algorithm works by repeatedly squaring the base and multiplying it by the result, while also reducing the exponent by half at each step. This allows us to compute the result efficiently, even for very large values of `exponent`.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```
print(power_mod(2, 10, 3)) # prints 2
print(power_mod(2, 10, 5)) # prints 3
print(power_mod(2, 10, 7)) # prints 5
```
Note that the result of the function is always in the range `[0, modulus-1]`, so if you want the result to be in the range `[1, modulus]`, you can simply add 1 to the result.</s>  ```
def power_mod(base, exponent, modulus):
    """
    Return base^exponent modulo modulus using the right-to-left binary method.
    """
    result = 1
    while exponent > 0:
        if exponent % 2 == 1:
            result = (result * base) % modulus
        base = (base * base) % modulus
        exponent //= 2
    return result
```
This code defines a function `power_mod` that takes three arguments: `base`, `exponent`, and `modulus`. It returns the result of raising `base` to the power of `exponent` modulo `modulus`.

The function uses the right-to-left binary method to compute the result. It starts with the initial value of `result` as 1, and then iteratively computes the result using the formula:
```
result = (result * base) % modulus
```
where `base` is the current value of `base`, and `modulus` is the modulus.

The function checks if the current exponent is odd, and if so, it multiplies the result by `base` and takes the modulus. It then divides the exponent by 2 and repeats the process until the exponent is 0.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```
print(power_mod(2, 10, 13))  # prints 9
```
This computes 2^10 modulo 13, which is 9.</s>  Here's a Python function that takes an integer `n` as input and returns `2**n % n`:
```
def power_mod(n):
    return 2**n % n
```
Here's an explanation of how the function works:

* `2**n` is the power operator, which raises 2 to the power of `n`. For example, `2**3` is equal to 8.
* `%` is the modulo operator, which returns the remainder of dividing the left-hand side by the right-hand side. For example, `7 % 3` is equal to 1.
* `n` is the input integer.

The function returns the result of `2**n % n`, which is equal to `2**n` modulo `n`.</s>  ```
def power_mod(n, p):
    return pow(n, p, n)
```
Explanation:

The `pow` function in Python can be used to calculate powers and modular arithmetic. The syntax is `pow(base, exponent, modulus)`. In this case, we want to calculate `n^p` (where `p` is the power) and then take the result modulo `n`. This is exactly what the `pow` function does when we pass in `n` as the modulus.

For example, if `n = 3` and `p = 5`, then `power_mod(n, p) = 3^5 = 243` and `243 % 3 = 0`, which is the correct answer.</s>  ```
def power_mod(base, exponent, modulus):
    result = 1
    while exponent > 0:
        if exponent % 2 == 1:
            result = (result * base) % modulus
        exponent //= 2
        base = (base * base) % modulus
    return result
```
This function computes the modular exponentiation of `base` raised to the power of `exponent` modulo `modulus`. It does this by repeatedly squaring the base and multiplying it by the appropriate power of the base, while keeping track of the exponent and reducing it by half at each step. The function returns the final result, which is the modular exponentiation of `base` raised to the power of `exponent` modulo `modulus`.

Here's an example of how to use this function:
```
print(power_mod(2, 10, 10)) # prints 6
```
This will compute 2^10 modulo 10, which is 6.</s>  Here's a possible solution:
```
def power_mod(base, exp, mod):
    result = 1
    while exp > 0:
        if exp % 2 == 1:
            result = (result * base) % mod
        exp //= 2
        base = (base * base) % mod
    return result
```
This function uses the modular exponentiation algorithm to compute `base^exp mod mod`. It works by repeatedly squaring the base and reducing the exponent by half, until the exponent is zero. At each step, it checks whether the exponent is odd, and if so, it multiplies the result by the base and reduces the modulus.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```
print(power_mod(2, 3, 5))  # prints 2
print(power_mod(3, 4, 7))  # prints 3
print(power_mod(10, 10, 100))  # prints 10
```
Note that this function assumes that the modulus is positive. If the modulus is negative, the result will be negative, which may not be what you want. In that case, you can use the `abs()` function to get the absolute value of the result.</s>  ```
def power_mod(base, exponent, modulus):
    if modulus == 1:
        return 0
    result = 1
    while exponent > 0:
        if exponent % 2 == 1:
            result = (result * base) % modulus
        exponent = exponent // 2
        base = (base * base) % modulus
    return result
```
This code uses the modular exponentiation algorithm to efficiently compute 2^n modulo n. The basic idea is to repeatedly square the base and reduce the exponent by half until the exponent is 1, at which point the result is returned. The modulus is used to reduce the intermediate results and ensure that they are in the range [0, n).

Here's an example of how to use the function:
```
print(power_mod(2, 10, 10))  # prints 10
print(power_mod(3, 10, 10))  # prints 3
print(power_mod(10, 10, 10))  # prints 0
```
This code uses the `power_mod` function to compute 2^n modulo n for n=10, and prints the result.</s>  ```
def power_mod(base, exponent, modulus):
    if modulus == 1:
        return 0
    result = 1
    for _ in range(exponent):
        result = (result * base) % modulus
    return result
```
This function takes three arguments: `base`, `exponent`, and `modulus`. It returns the value of `base` raised to the power of `exponent` modulo `modulus`.

Here's an explanation of how the function works:

1. If `modulus` is 1, the function returns 0. This is because any number raised to the power of 0 is 1, and 1 modulo 1 is 0.
2. The function initializes a variable `result` to 1. This will be the result of the calculation.
3. The function uses a loop to iterate `exponent` times.
4. In each iteration, the function multiplies `result` by `base` and takes the result modulo `modulus`. This is equivalent to raising `result` to the power of `exponent` modulo `modulus`.
5. The function returns the final value of `result`.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```
print(power_mod(2, 10, 10))  # prints 2
print(power_mod(3, 5, 10))   # prints 3
print(power_mod(4, 2, 10))   # prints 4
```
Note that the function assumes that `base` and `modulus` are positive integers. If `base` is negative, the function will return an incorrect result. If `modulus` is 0, the function will raise a ZeroDivisionError.</s>  ```
def power_mod(n, p):
    return pow(n, p, p)
```
This function uses the built-in `pow` function to calculate `n` raised to the power of `p` modulo `p`. This is done using the third argument of `pow`, which specifies the modulus.

Here's an example of how to use this function:
```
print(power_mod(2, 10)) # Output: 2
print(power_mod(3, 10)) # Output: 3
print(power_mod(4, 10)) # Output: 4
print(power_mod(5, 10)) # Output: 5
```
Note that this function only works for positive integers `n` and `p`. If you need to handle negative numbers or non-integer exponents, you will need to modify the function accordingly.</s>
