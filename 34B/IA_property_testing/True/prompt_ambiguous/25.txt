Prompt: Return prime factorization of a given integer.
-------------------
  Sure, here's a test suite using the Hypothesis library to test a future solution for the problem of returning the prime factorization of a given integer:
```
from hypothesis import given, strategies

def property_test(candidate_function):
    @given(strategies.integers())
    def property_1(n):
        result = candidate_function(n)
        assert all(isinstance(x, int) and x > 1 for x in result)
        assert len(result) == len(set(result))

    @given(strategies.integers())
    def property_2(n):
        result = candidate_function(n)
        assert all(x in result for x in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1))

    return [property_1, property_2]
```
This test suite includes two property tests:

1. `property_1`: This test checks that the output of the function is a list of integers greater than 1, and that all elements in the list are unique.
2. `property_2`: This test checks that the output of the function is a list of integers that includes all prime factors of the input integer.

Both tests use the `strategies.integers()` strategy from the Hypothesis library to generate random integer inputs for the function. The `given` decorator is used to specify the input to the function. The `assert` statements are used to check the expected properties of the output.</s>  ```

This code uses a simple trial division algorithm to find the prime factors of a given integer. It starts by checking if the input number is 1, and if so, returns [1]. Otherwise, it iterates from 2 to the square root of the input number, and checks if the number is divisible by any of the numbers in that range. If a divisor is found, the function calls itself recursively on the quotient of the input number and the divisor, and extends the list of factors with the divisor and the result of the recursive call. If no divisor is found, the function simply appends the input number to the list of factors and returns it.

Here is an example of how to use this function:
```
print(prime_factorization(12))  # Output: [2, 2, 3]
print(prime_factorization(15))  # Output: [3, 5]
print(prime_factorization(24))  # Output: [2, 2, 2, 3]
```
This code is not optimized for performance, but it is correct and easy to understand. If you need to optimize the code for performance, you can use more advanced algorithms such as the Sieve of Eratosthenes or the Pollard rho algorithm.</s>  ```

This function uses a simple trial division algorithm to find the prime factors of a given integer. It first checks if the input number is 1, and if so, it returns the list [1]. Otherwise, it iterates from 2 to the square root of the input number, and for each iteration, it checks if the number is divisible by the current iteration number. If it is, it appends the current iteration number to a list of factors and recursively calls the function with the input number divided by the current iteration number. If the number is not divisible by the current iteration number, it appends the current iteration number to the list of factors and breaks out of the loop. Finally, it returns the list of factors.

Here's an example of how to use this function:
```
print(prime_factorization(12))  # Output: [2, 2, 3]
print(prime_factorization(15))  # Output: [3, 5]
print(prime_factorization(24))  # Output: [2, 2, 2, 3]
```
Note that this function assumes that the input number is a positive integer. If the input number is 0 or negative, the function will raise a ValueError.</s>  ```

This function uses a simple trial division algorithm to find the prime factors of a given integer. It first checks if the input is 1, and if so, returns the list `[1]`. Otherwise, it iterates from 2 to the square root of the input, and for each factor found, it adds the factor to the list and recursively calls the function to find the prime factors of the input divided by the factor. If no factor is found, the function returns the input as a single prime factor.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```
print(prime_factorization(12))  # Output: [2, 2, 3]
print(prime_factorization(15))  # Output: [3, 5]
print(prime_factorization(24))  # Output: [2, 2, 2, 3]

            n //= i
    if n > 2:

    if n == 1:
        return [1]

    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            factors.append(i)
            factors.extend(prime_factorization(n // i))
            break
    else:
        factors.append(n)
    return factors
```
This code uses a simple trial division algorithm to find the prime factors of a given integer `n`. It first checks if `n` is 1, and if so, returns the list `[1]`. Otherwise, it iterates from 2 to the square root of `n`, and for each factor `i`, it checks if `n` is divisible by `i`. If it is, it appends `i` to the list of factors and recursively calls the function with `n // i` (i.e., `n` divided by `i`). If no factor is found, it appends `n` to the list of factors.

Here's an explanation of how the code works:

1. The function starts by checking if `n` is 1. If it is, the function returns the list `[1]`.
2. If `n` is not 1, the function initializes an empty list called `factors`.
3. The function then iterates from 2 to the square root of `n` (inclusive). For each iteration, it checks if `n` is divisible by the current number `i`.
4. If `n` is divisible by `i`, the function appends `i` to the list of factors and recursively calls the function with `n // i`.
5. If no factor is found, the function appends `n` to the list of factors and returns the list of factors.

For example, if we call the function with `n = 12`, the function will iterate from 2 to 3 and find that `n` is divisible by 2. It will then append 2 to the list of factors and recursively call the function with `n // 2 = 6`. The function will then iterate from 2 to 3 again and find that `n` is divisible by 3. It will then append 3 to the list of factors and return the list of factors, which is `[2, 2, 3]`.

Note that this code uses a recursive approach, which means that the function calls itself repeatedly until it finds the prime factors of `n`. This can be more efficient than using a loop, especially for large values of `n`. However, it can also be less efficient for very large values of `n`, as it requires more memory to store the recursive calls.</s>
