Prompt: Return true if a given number is prime, and false otherwise.
-------------------
  Here is a test suite that uses the Hypothesis library to generate property tests for a hypothetical future solution to the problem of determining whether a given number is prime:
```
from hypothesis import given, strategies

def property_test(candidate_function):
    @given(strategies.integers)
    def property_1(n):
        assert candidate_function(n) == (n > 1 and n % 2 != 0)

    @given(strategies.integers)
    def property_2(n):
        assert candidate_function(n) == (n > 1 and n % 3 != 0)

    return [property_1, property_2]
```
This test suite uses the `strategies` module from Hypothesis to generate two sets of inputs: one for positive integers, and one for negative integers. It then defines two property tests, `property_1` and `property_2`, that test the candidate function for the two sets of inputs.

The first property test, `property_1`, tests the candidate function for positive integers. It asserts that the candidate function returns `True` if the input is greater than 1 and not divisible by 2. This test is designed to catch errors in the candidate function that would cause it to return `False` for positive integers that are not prime.

The second property test, `property_2`, tests the candidate function for negative integers. It asserts that the candidate function returns `True` if the input is greater than 1 and not divisible by 3. This test is designed to catch errors in the candidate function that would cause it to return `False` for negative integers that are not prime.

Finally, the `property_test` function returns a list containing the two property tests. This list can be used to run the property tests on a hypothetical future solution to the problem of determining whether a given number is prime.</s>  ```

This code uses a simple algorithm to check if a given number is prime. It starts by checking if the number is less than 2, as all numbers less than 2 are not prime. If the number is not less than 2, it then checks if any of the numbers from 2 to the square root of the number (inclusive) divide the number without a remainder. If any such number is found, the number is not prime and the function returns false. If no such number is found, the number is prime and the function returns true.</s>  ```

    if n <= 1:
        return False

            return False
    return True
```
This code uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to determine if a given number is prime. It iterates from 2 to the square root of the number and checks if the number is divisible by any of the numbers in the range. If it finds a divisor, it returns False, otherwise it returns True.</s>  def is_prime(n):

        if n % i == 0:

    return True</s>  ```

This code uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to determine whether a given number is prime. It starts by checking if the number is less than 2, and if it is, it returns False. If the number is greater than or equal to 2, it loops through the numbers 2 to the square root of the number, and checks if the number is divisible by any of the numbers in the range. If the number is divisible by any of the numbers in the range, it returns False. If the number is not divisible by any of the numbers in the range, it returns True.

For example, if we call the function with the number 5, it will return False, because 5 is not prime (it is divisible by 5). If we call the function with the number 7, it will return True, because 7 is prime (it is not divisible by any other number except for 1 and itself).

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.</s>  Here's a simple Python function that returns true if a given number is prime, and false otherwise:
```
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```
This function uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to efficiently check if a number is prime. It starts by checking if the number is less than 2, since all numbers less than 2 are not prime. If the number is greater than or equal to 2, it uses a loop to iterate over all numbers up to the square root of the number (since there is no need to check numbers beyond the square root of the number). If any of the numbers in the loop divide the given number evenly, the number is not prime and the function returns false. Otherwise, the function returns true.

For example, if we call the function with the number 13, it will return true, since 13 is a prime number. If we call the function with the number 14, it will return false, since 14 is not a prime number.</s>
