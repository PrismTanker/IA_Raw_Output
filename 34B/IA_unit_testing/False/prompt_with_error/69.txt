Prompt: You are given a non-empty list of positive integers. Return the greatest integer that is greater than 
    zero, and has a frequency greater than the value of the integer itself. 
    The frequency of an integer is the number of times it appears in the list.
    If no such a value exist, return -1.

This test suite includes four tests:

1. "basic": Tests a basic case where there is a value greater than the frequency of the integer.
2. "single element": Tests a case where there is only one element in the list.
3. "no such value": Tests a case where there is no value greater than the frequency of the integer.
4. "duplicate elements": Tests a case where there are duplicate elements in the list.
5. "large input": Tests a case with a large input.

Note that the output for each test is the expected output for the given input.</s>  ```

This code uses the `collections.Counter` class to count the frequency of each integer in the list. It then finds the maximum frequency and checks if there is an integer with a frequency greater than its value and greater than zero. If such an integer exists, it returns it, otherwise it returns -1.

Here's an example usage:
```
>>> find_greater_frequency([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
4
>>> find_greater_frequency([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])
-1
