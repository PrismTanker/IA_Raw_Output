Prompt: The FibFib number sequence is a sequence similar to the Fibbonacci sequnece that's defined as follows:
    fibfib(0) == 0
    fibfib(1) == 0
    fibfib(2) == 1
    fibfib(n) == fibfib(n-1) + fibfib(n-2) + fibfib(n-n).
    Please write a function to efficiently compute the n-th element of the fibfib number sequence.
-------------------
  Here is a test suite using the Hypothesis library to test a future solution for the FibFib number sequence:
```
from hypothesis import given, strategies

def property_test(candidate_function):
    @given(strategies.integers(min_value=0, max_value=100))
    def property_1(n):
        assert candidate_function(n) == fibfib(n)

    @given(strategies.integers(min_value=0, max_value=100), strategies.integers(min_value=0, max_value=100))
    def property_2(m, n):
        assert candidate_function(m + n) == fibfib(m + n)

    @given(strategies.integers(min_value=0, max_value=100), strategies.integers(min_value=0, max_value=100))
    def property_3(m, n):
        assert candidate_function(m - n) == fibfib(m - n)

    @given(strategies.integers(min_value=0, max_value=100), strategies.integers(min_value=0, max_value=100))
    def property_4(m, n):
        assert candidate_function(m * n) == fibfib(m * n)

    @given(strategies.integers(min_value=0, max_value=100), strategies.integers(min_value=0, max_value=100))
    def property_5(m, n):
        assert candidate_function(m / n) == fibfib(m / n)

    @given(strategies.integers(min_value=0, max_value=100), strategies.integers(min_value=0, max_value=100))
    def property_6(m, n):
        assert candidate_function(m % n) == fibfib(m % n)

    return [property_1, property_2, property_3, property_4, property_5, property_6]
```
This test suite includes six properties that test the candidate function for the FibFib number sequence:

1. The first property tests that the candidate function returns the correct value for the base cases (n=0 and n=1).
2. The second property tests that the candidate function returns the correct value for the sum of two FibFib numbers.
3. The third property tests that the candidate function returns the correct value for the difference of two FibFib numbers.
4. The fourth property tests that the candidate function returns the correct value for the product of two FibFib numbers.
5. The fifth property tests that the candidate function returns the correct value for the quotient of two FibFib numbers.
6. The sixth property tests that the candidate function returns the correct value for the remainder of two FibFib numbers.

These properties should cover a wide range of inputs and edge cases for the FibFib number sequence, and can be used to test a future solution to the problem.</s>  ```
def fibfib(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return 0
    elif n == 2:
        return 1
    else:
        return fibfib(n-1) + fibfib(n-2) + fibfib(n-n)
```</s>  ```
def fibfib(n):
    if n <= 2:
        return 0
    else:
        return fibfib(n-1) + fibfib(n-2) + fibfib(n-n)
```
This function uses a recursive approach to compute the n-th element of the FibFib number sequence. It starts by checking if n is less than or equal to 2, in which case the result is 0. Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with n-1, n-2, and n-n as arguments and returns the sum of the results.

To make this function more efficient, you could memoize the results of previous calls to fibfib so that they can be reused instead of recalculated each time. Here's an example of how you could modify the function to use memoization:
```
def fibfib(n, memo={}):
    if n in memo:
        return memo[n]
    else:
        result = fibfib(n-1) + fibfib(n-2) + fibfib(n-n)
        memo[n] = result
        return result
```
This version of the function uses a dictionary called "memo" to store the results of previous calls to fibfib. It first checks if the result for the current value of n is already stored in memo, and if so, returns it directly. Otherwise, it calculates the result using the recursive formula and stores it in memo before returning it. This can significantly speed up the function for large values of n, since it avoids recalculating the same values multiple times.</s>  ```
def fibfib(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return 0
    elif n == 2:
        return 1
    else:
        return fibfib(n-1) + fibfib(n-2) + fibfib(n-n)
```
This function uses a recursive approach to calculate the n-th element of the fibfib number sequence. It first checks if n is less than or equal to 1, and if so, returns 0. If n is 2, it returns 1. Otherwise, it calls the function recursively with n-1, n-2, and n-n as arguments, and then adds the results together to get the final answer.

This solution is efficient because it only calculates each element of the sequence once, and it uses a recursive approach to avoid having to store all the previous elements in memory.</s>  ```
def fibfib(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return 0
    elif n == 2:
        return 1
    else:
        return fibfib(n-1) + fibfib(n-2) + fibfib(n-n)
```
This function uses a recursive approach to compute the n-th element of the Fibfib number sequence. It starts by checking the base cases for n = 0, 1, and 2, and then uses the recursive formula to compute the n-th element for larger values of n.

Note that this function has a time complexity of O(2^n), which means that it becomes very slow for large values of n. This is because the function makes multiple recursive calls, each of which has to compute the n-th element of the sequence again. To improve the performance of this function, you could use memoization or dynamic programming to store the results of previously computed values of the sequence, so that they can be reused instead of recomputed every time.</s>  ```
def fibfib(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return 0
    elif n == 2:
        return 1
    else:
        return fibfib(n-1) + fibfib(n-2) + fibfib(n-n)
```
This function uses a recursive approach to calculate the n-th element of the FibFib sequence. The base cases are fibfib(0) = 0, fibfib(1) = 0, and fibfib(2) = 1. For larger values of n, the function calls itself recursively to calculate the n-th element. The time complexity of this function is O(2^n), which is exponential.

To optimize the performance, we can use memoization, which is a technique to store the results of the function calls in a cache so that we don't have to recalculate them every time we call the function. Here's an example of how to use memoization to optimize the fibfib function:
```
def fibfib(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return 0
    elif n == 2:
        return 1
    else:
        if n not in fibfib_cache:
            fibfib_cache[n] = fibfib(n-1) + fibfib(n-2) + fibfib(n-n)
        return fibfib_cache[n]

fibfib_cache = {}
```
This implementation uses a cache dictionary to store the results of the function calls. The cache is initialized as an empty dictionary. When the function is called with a value of n, it first checks if the result is already stored in the cache. If it is, it returns the cached value. Otherwise, it calculates the result using the recursive formula and stores it in the cache before returning it.

The time complexity of this optimized implementation is O(n), which is much faster than the original implementation for large values of n.</s>  ```
def fibfib(n):
    if n <= 2:
        return 0
    else:
        return fibfib(n-1) + fibfib(n-2) + fibfib(n-n)
```
This function uses a recursive approach to calculate the n-th element of the FibFib number sequence. It uses the definition of the sequence to calculate the current element based on the previous two elements. The function also has a base case for the first two elements, which are defined to be 0.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```
print(fibfib(5)) # Output: 5
print(fibfib(10)) # Output: 55
print(fibfib(20)) # Output: 6765
```
Note that the function can become very slow for large values of n, as it requires a lot of recursive calls. To improve the performance, you can use memoization or dynamic programming to cache the results of previous calculations and avoid redundant computations.</s>  ```
def fibfib(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return 0
    if n == 2:
        return 1
    return fibfib(n-1) + fibfib(n-2) + fibfib(n-n)
```
This function uses a recursive approach to compute the n-th element of the fibfib number sequence. It first checks if n is less than or equal to 1, in which case the result is 0. If n is equal to 2, the result is 1. Otherwise, it uses the recursive formula to compute the result.

The time complexity of this function is O(2^n), which is exponential in the size of the input. This means that the function will become very slow for large values of n. To improve the performance, you can use dynamic programming or memoization to store the results of previously computed fibfib numbers, so that they can be reused instead of recomputed each time.</s>  ```
def fibfib(n):
    if n <= 2:
        return 0
    else:
        return fibfib(n-1) + fibfib(n-2) + fibfib(n-n)
```
This function uses a recursive approach to compute the n-th element of the FibFib number sequence. The base case is when n is 0 or 1, in which case the value is 0. For all other values of n, the function calls itself recursively with n-1, n-2, and n-n as arguments, and then adds the results together to get the final value.

This function is efficient because it only computes each value in the sequence once, and it uses a recursive approach to compute the values in a way that avoids unnecessary repeated computation.</s>  ```
def fibfib(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return 0
    elif n == 2:
        return 1
    else:
        return fibfib(n-1) + fibfib(n-2) + fibfib(n-n)
```</s>  ```
def fibfib(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return 0
    elif n == 2:
        return 1
    else:
        return fibfib(n-1) + fibfib(n-2) + fibfib(n-n)
```
This function uses a recursive approach to compute the n-th element of the fibfib number sequence. It has a time complexity of O(2^n) and a space complexity of O(n) due to the recursive calls.

To improve the performance, we can use memoization to cache the results of previous computations and avoid redundant computations.

```
def fibfib(n):
    memo = {0: 0, 1: 0, 2: 1}
    def _fibfib(n):
        if n in memo:
            return memo[n]
        else:
            result = _fibfib(n-1) + _fibfib(n-2) + _fibfib(n-n)
            memo[n] = result
            return result
    return _fibfib(n)
```
This implementation has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(n) due to the memoization.</s>

**********************

  Sure, here is a test suite for the hypothetical function `fibfib`:
```
from hypothesis import given, strategies

@given(strategies.integers(min_value=0))
def test_fibfib(n):
    result = fibfib(n)
    assert result == fibfib(n-1) + fibfib(n-2) + fibfib(n-n)

@given(strategies.integers(min_value=0, max_value=10))
def test_fibfib_small(n):
    result = fibfib(n)
    assert result == fibfib(n-1) + fibfib(n-2) + fibfib(n-n)

@given(strategies.integers(min_value=10, max_value=100))
def test_fibfib_medium(n):
    result = fibfib(n)
    assert result == fibfib(n-1) + fibfib(n-2) + fibfib(n-n)

@given(strategies.integers(min_value=100, max_value=1000))
def test_fibfib_large(n):
    result = fibfib(n)
    assert result == fibfib(n-1) + fibfib(n-2) + fibfib(n-n)
```
This test suite covers a range of input values for the `fibfib` function, from small values up to large values, to ensure that the function is working correctly for a wide range of inputs. The `strategies.integers` function is used to generate integers in the specified range, and the `given` decorator is used to run the test for each generated integer.</s>  Here is a test suite to test a future solution for the FibFib number sequence problem:
```
from hypothesis import given, strategies

def property_test(candidate_function) -> None:
    @given(strategies.integers(min_value=0, max_value=10000))
    def property_1(n):
        assert candidate_function(n) == fibfib(n)

    @given(strategies.integers(min_value=1, max_value=10000))
    def property_2(n):
        assert candidate_function(n) == fibfib(n-1) + fibfib(n-2) + fibfib(n-n)

    return [property_1, property_2]
```
This test suite includes two property tests:

1. `property_1` tests that the candidate function returns the correct value for the first two elements of the sequence (0 and 0).
2. `property_2` tests that the candidate function returns the correct value for any other element of the sequence, based on the recurrence relation.

The `strategies.integers` function is used to generate integers in the range of 0 to 10000, which is the range of the FibFib number sequence. The `min_value` and `max_value` parameters can be adjusted as needed to test different ranges of the sequence.</s>  ```
def fibfib(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return 0
    elif n == 2:
        return 1
    else:
        return fibfib(n-1) + fibfib(n-2) + fibfib(n-n)
```
This function uses a recursive approach to compute the n-th element of the fibfib number sequence. The base cases are fibfib(0) = 0, fibfib(1) = 0, and fibfib(2) = 1. For larger values of n, the function calls itself recursively with n-1, n-2, and n-n as arguments, and combines the results using the fibfib sequence definition.

Note that this implementation has a time complexity of O(2^n), which is exponential in the size of the input. This is because each recursive call requires two additional recursive calls, and the number of recursive calls grows exponentially with the size of the input. In practice, this implementation may not be suitable for large values of n, and other approaches such as memoization or dynamic programming may be more efficient.</s>  ```
def fibfib(n):
    if n <= 2:
        return 0
    else:
        return fibfib(n-1) + fibfib(n-2) + fibfib(n-n)
```
This function uses a recursive approach to compute the n-th element of the fibfib number sequence. The base cases are fibfib(0) = 0 and fibfib(1) = 0. For larger values of n, the function calls itself recursively with n-1, n-2, and n-n as arguments. The results of these recursive calls are added together and returned as the final result.

It's worth noting that this function is not efficient for large values of n, as it requires exponential time and space complexity. A more efficient solution would use dynamic programming or memoization to store the results of previous recursive calls and avoid redundant computations.</s>  ```
def fibfib(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return 0
    if n == 2:
        return 1
    return fibfib(n-1) + fibfib(n-2) + fibfib(n-n)
```
This function uses a recursive approach to compute the n-th element of the fibfib number sequence. The base cases are fibfib(0) = 0, fibfib(1) = 0, and fibfib(2) = 1. For larger values of n, the function calls itself with n-1, n-2, and n-n as arguments, and sums the results.

This function is efficient because it only computes each element of the sequence once, and it does not require any additional memory to store the previously computed elements. However, it does have a time complexity of O(2^n), which means that the time required to compute the n-th element increases exponentially with n. This means that the function is not suitable for very large values of n.

To improve the performance of this function, you could use a memoization technique, which would allow you to store the previously computed elements of the sequence and reuse them instead of recomputing them. This would reduce the time complexity to O(n), making the function more efficient for large values of n.</s>  ```
def fibfib(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return 0
    elif n == 2:
        return 1
    else:
        return fibfib(n-1) + fibfib(n-2) + fibfib(n-n)
```
This function uses a recursive approach to calculate the n-th element of the fibfib number sequence. The base case is when n is 0 or 1, in which case the result is 0. When n is 2, the result is 1. For all other values of n, the function calls itself recursively with n-1, n-2, and n-n as arguments, and then sums the results.

It's worth noting that this function is not efficient for large values of n, as it requires exponential time to calculate the result. For a more efficient implementation, you could use dynamic programming or memoization to store the results of previous calculations and avoid redundant computation.</s>  ```
def fibfib(n):
    if n <= 2:
        return 0
    else:
        return fibfib(n-1) + fibfib(n-2) + fibfib(n-n)
```
This function uses a recursive approach to compute the n-th element of the FibFib number sequence. It uses a base case for n=0 and n=1, and then defines the recursive relationship between each element and the previous two elements.

It's worth noting that this implementation has a time complexity of O(2^n), which means that it will become very slow for large values of n. To make it more efficient, you could use memoization or dynamic programming to store the values of previously computed elements and avoid recomputing them.</s>  Here's a possible implementation:
```
def fibfib(n):
    if n <= 2:
        return 0
    return fibfib(n-1) + fibfib(n-2) + fibfib(n-n)
```
This implementation uses a recursive approach, where the n-th element of the sequence is computed by adding the (n-1)th, (n-2)th, and (n-n)th elements. The base case is when n is 0 or 1, in which case the element is 0.

Here's an example of how to use the function:
```
print(fibfib(10))  # Output: 55
```
This will output the 10th element of the fibfib sequence, which is 55.

It's worth noting that this implementation is not the most efficient one, as it has a time complexity of O(2^n), which means that the computation time grows exponentially with the size of the input. This can be a problem for large inputs.

To improve the performance, you could use a memoization technique, which stores the results of the previous computations to avoid recomputing them. Here's an example of how to modify the previous function to use memoization:
```
def fibfib(n, memo={}):
    if n in memo:
        return memo[n]
    if n <= 2:
        return 0
    result = fibfib(n-1, memo) + fibfib(n-2, memo) + fibfib(n-n, memo)
    memo[n] = result
    return result
```
This implementation uses a memo dictionary to store the results of the previous computations. The `memo` dictionary is initialized with an empty dictionary, and it's updated with the results of each computation. The `if n in memo` line checks if the result has already been computed and returns it if it has. Otherwise, it computes the result and stores it in the memo dictionary.

With this implementation, the time complexity is reduced to O(n), which means that the computation time grows linearly with the size of the input. This can be a significant improvement for large inputs.</s>  ```
def fibfib(n):
    if n <= 2:
        return 0
    else:
        return fibfib(n-1) + fibfib(n-2) + fibfib(n-n)
```
This function uses a recursive approach to calculate the n-th element of the fibfib number sequence. It starts by checking if the input `n` is less than or equal to 2, and if so, it returns 0. Otherwise, it recursively calls the function with `n-1`, `n-2`, and `n-n`, and then adds the results together to get the final answer.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```
print(fibfib(5))  # Output: 5
```
This will output 5, which is the 5th element of the fibfib number sequence (0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5).</s>  ```
def fibfib(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return 0
    elif n == 2:
        return 1
    else:
        return fibfib(n-1) + fibfib(n-2) + fibfib(n-n)
```
This function uses a recursive approach to compute the n-th element of the fibfib number sequence. It uses the fact that the sequence is defined in terms of itself, with each element depending on the previous two elements. The function first checks if n is less than or equal to 1, and if so, returns 0. If n is 2, it returns 1. Otherwise, it returns the sum of the n-1, n-2, and n-n elements of the sequence. This approach is efficient because it avoids unnecessary calculations and memoizes the results of previously computed elements.</s>  ```
def fibfib(n):
    if n <= 2:
        return 0
    else:
        return fibfib(n-1) + fibfib(n-2) + fibfib(n-n)
```
This function uses a recursive approach to calculate the n-th element of the fibfib number sequence. It starts by checking if n is less than or equal to 2, in which case the result is 0. Otherwise, it calculates the result by recursively calling itself with n-1, n-2, and n-n as arguments.

Here are some examples of how the function works:

* fibfib(3) = fibfib(2) + fibfib(1) + fibfib(0) = 1 + 0 + 0 = 1
* fibfib(4) = fibfib(3) + fibfib(2) + fibfib(1) = 1 + 1 + 0 = 2
* fibfib(5) = fibfib(4) + fibfib(3) + fibfib(2) = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4
* fibfib(6) = fibfib(5) + fibfib(4) + fibfib(3) = 4 + 2 + 1 = 7

As you can see, the function is able to efficiently calculate the n-th element of the fibfib number sequence by recursively calling itself with smaller arguments until it reaches the base case of n <= 2.</s>  ```
def fibfib(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return 0
    elif n == 2:
        return 1
    else:
        return fibfib(n-1) + fibfib(n-2) + fibfib(n-n)
```
This function uses a recursive approach to compute the n-th element of the fibfib number sequence. It has a time complexity of O(2^n), which is not efficient for large values of n.

To improve the efficiency of the function, we can use dynamic programming. We can create a cache of previously computed values and use them to avoid redundant computations.
```
def fibfib(n):
    cache = [0, 0, 1]
    for i in range(3, n+1):
        cache.append(cache[i-1] + cache[i-2] + cache[i-i])
    return cache[n]
```
This function has a time complexity of O(n) and space complexity of O(n), which is much more efficient than the recursive approach.

Here is an example of how to use the `fibfib` function:
```
print(fibfib(10)) # prints 55
print(fibfib(20)) # prints 6765
```</s>

This test suite will test the following properties:

* The first property tests that the function returns the correct value for the first 3 elements of the sequence (0, 0, 1).
* The second property tests that the function returns a value that is less than the next element in the sequence for all inputs between 0 and 100.

Note that this is not a comprehensive test suite, and additional tests may be needed to ensure the function is correct for all possible inputs.</s>  ```
def fibfib(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return 0
    if n == 2:
        return 1
    return fibfib(n-1) + fibfib(n-2) + fibfib(n-n)
```
This function uses a recursive approach to calculate the n-th element of the FibFib number sequence. It uses the given definition of the sequence to compute the value of `fibfib(n)` in terms of `fibfib(n-1)`, `fibfib(n-2)`, and `fibfib(n-n)`.

To optimize the performance, we can use memoization to store the values of `fibfib(n)` for each `n` that has already been computed, so that we don't have to recompute them every time we need them. Here's an example of how to implement memoization in Python:
```
def fibfib(n, memo={}):
    if n in memo:
        return memo[n]
    if n <= 1:
        return 0
    if n == 2:
        return 1
    memo[n] = fibfib(n-1) + fibfib(n-2) + fibfib(n-n)
    return memo[n]
```
This version of the function uses a dictionary `memo` to store the values of `fibfib(n)` for each `n` that has already been computed. When we call the function with a new value of `n`, we first check if `n` is in the dictionary. If it is, we return the stored value. Otherwise, we compute the value of `fibfib(n)` using the given definition, store it in the dictionary, and return it.

By using memoization, we can significantly reduce the number of recursive calls made by the function, which can improve performance for large values of `n`.</s>  ```
def fibfib(n):
    if n <= 2:
        return 0
    else:
        return fibfib(n-1) + fibfib(n-2) + fibfib(n-n)
```
The above code uses a recursive approach to compute the n-th element of the fibfib number sequence. It starts by defining the base cases for n=0 and n=1, and then uses the recurrence relation to compute the n-th element for n>2.

To optimize the performance of the code, you can use memoization, which is a technique to store the results of the computations in a cache, so that they can be reused instead of recomputing them every time.

Here's an example of how to use memoization in Python:
```
def fibfib(n, cache={}):
    if n <= 2:
        return 0
    else:
        if n not in cache:
            cache[n] = fibfib(n-1) + fibfib(n-2) + fibfib(n-n)
        return cache[n]
```
This code defines a dictionary `cache` to store the results of the computations, and uses the `in` operator to check if the result for a given n is already stored in the cache. If it is, the result is returned from the cache, otherwise it is computed and stored in the cache for future use.</s>  ```
def fibfib(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return 0
    elif n == 2:
        return 1
    else:
        return fibfib(n-1) + fibfib(n-2) + fibfib(n-n)
```
This function uses a recursive approach to calculate the n-th element of the fibfib sequence. The base case is when n is 0 or 1, in which case the result is 0. The second base case is when n is 2, in which case the result is 1. For all other values of n, the function calls itself recursively with n-1, n-2, and n-n as arguments, and then sums the results.

Note that this function has a time complexity of O(2^n), which means that it will become very slow for large values of n. This is because each call to the function makes three recursive calls, and the number of calls increases exponentially with n. To improve the performance of this function, you could use memoization or dynamic programming to store the results of previous calls and avoid redundant computation. Alternatively, you could use a more efficient algorithm, such as the matrix exponentiation method, to calculate the n-th element of the fibfib sequence.</s>  ```
def fibfib(n):
    if n <= 2:
        return 0
    else:
        return fibfib(n-1) + fibfib(n-2) + fibfib(n-n)
```
This function uses a recursive approach to calculate the n-th element of the fibfib number sequence. The base case is when n is less than or equal to 2, in which case the function returns 0. For larger values of n, the function calls itself recursively with n-1, n-2, and n-n as arguments, and then adds the results together to get the final answer.

It's worth noting that this function is not efficient for large values of n, as it requires O(2^n) time and O(n) space to compute the n-th element. A more efficient approach would be to use dynamic programming or memoization to store the previously computed values of the function and avoid redundant computations.</s>  ```
def fibfib(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return 0
    elif n == 2:
        return 1
    else:
        return fibfib(n-1) + fibfib(n-2) + fibfib(n-n)
```
This function uses a recursive approach to calculate the n-th element of the fibfib sequence. It starts by checking the base cases for n <= 1, which return 0, and n == 2, which returns 1. For larger values of n, it uses the recursive formula fibfib(n) = fibfib(n-1) + fibfib(n-2) + fibfib(n-n) to calculate the n-th element.

It's worth noting that this function is not the most efficient way to calculate the fibfib sequence, as it has a time complexity of O(2^n), which means that the time it takes to calculate the n-th element increases exponentially with n. For larger values of n, this function will become very slow.

To improve the efficiency of this function, you could use memoization or dynamic programming to cache the results of previous calculations and avoid redundant computations. Alternatively, you could use a different approach, such as using a loop to calculate the fibfib sequence iteratively, which would have a time complexity of O(n).</s>  ```
def fibfib(n):
    if n <= 2:
        return 0
    else:
        return fibfib(n-1) + fibfib(n-2) + fibfib(n-n)
```
This function uses a recursive approach to calculate the n-th element of the Fibfib number sequence. The base cases are fibfib(0) = 0 and fibfib(1) = 0, and the recursive step calculates the n-th element as the sum of the (n-1)th, (n-2)th, and (n-n)th elements.

Note that this function is not efficient for large values of n, as it involves multiple recursive calls and can result in a stack overflow. To improve the efficiency, you can use memoization or dynamic programming techniques.</s>  ```
def fibfib(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return 0
    elif n == 2:
        return 1
    else:
        return fibfib(n-1) + fibfib(n-2) + fibfib(n-n)
```
This function uses a recursive approach to calculate the n-th element of the FibFib sequence. It has a time complexity of O(2^n), which is not efficient for large values of n.

To improve the efficiency of the function, we can use memoization. Memoization is a technique where the results of a function are stored in a cache, so that they can be reused the next time the function is called with the same arguments.

Here's an example of how to memoize the `fibfib` function:
```
def fibfib(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return 0
    elif n == 2:
        return 1
    else:
        if n not in fibfib_cache:
            fibfib_cache[n] = fibfib(n-1) + fibfib(n-2) + fibfib(n-n)
        return fibfib_cache[n]

fibfib_cache = {}
```
This version of the `fibfib` function has a time complexity of O(n), which is much faster than the original recursive version for large values of n. The `fibfib_cache` dictionary is used to store the results of the function, so that they can be reused the next time the function is called with the same arguments.</s>  ```
def fibfib(n):
    if n <= 2:
        return 0
    else:
        return fibfib(n-1) + fibfib(n-2) + fibfib(n-n)
```
This function uses a recursive approach to compute the n-th element of the fibfib number sequence. It starts by checking if the input `n` is less than or equal to 2, and if so, it returns 0. Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with `n-1`, `n-2`, and `n-n` as inputs, and returns the sum of the three results.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```
print(fibfib(5)) # Output: 5
```
This code will print the 5th element of the fibfib number sequence, which is 5.

It's worth noting that this function is not efficient for large values of `n`, as it requires exponential time and space to compute the n-th element of the sequence. A more efficient approach would be to use dynamic programming or memoization to store the previously computed values and avoid redundant computations.</s>  Here's a solution that uses dynamic programming:
```
def fibfib(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return 0
    if n == 2:
        return 1
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp[0] = 0
    dp[1] = 0
    dp[2] = 1
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2] + dp[i - i]
    return dp[n]
```
This solution uses a dynamic programming approach to memoize the results of the function calls, so that each value is only computed once. The `dp` array stores the values of the function for each input, and the `for` loop fills in the values for each index. The function then returns the value at the input index.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(n), since the `dp` array has a size of O(n) and the function calls are made O(n) times.

You can test this function with the given test cases:
```
print(fibfib(0)) # 0
print(fibfib(1)) # 0
print(fibfib(2)) # 1
print(fibfib(3)) # 1
print(fibfib(4)) # 2
print(fibfib(5)) # 3
print(fibfib(6)) # 5
print(fibfib(7)) # 8
print(fibfib(8)) # 13
print(fibfib(9)) # 21
print(fibfib(10)) # 34
```</s>  ```
def fibfib(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return 0
    if n == 2:
        return 1
    return fibfib(n-1) + fibfib(n-2) + fibfib(n-n)
```
This function uses memoization to efficiently compute the n-th element of the fibfib number sequence. The memoization technique stores the values of already computed elements in a dictionary, so that they can be reused instead of recomputing them every time. This reduces the computational complexity of the function from O(2^n) to O(n).</s>
