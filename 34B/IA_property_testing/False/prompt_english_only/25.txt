Prompt: Return list of prime factors of given integer in the order from smallest to largest.
    Each of the factors should be listed number of times corresponding to how many times it appeares in factorization.
    Input number should be equal to the product of all factors
-------------------
  Here's a test suite for the hypothetical solution using the Hypothesis library:
```
from hypothesis import given, strategies

def property_test(candidate_function) -> None:
    @given(strategies.integers(min_value=1))
    def property_1(n):
        factors = candidate_function(n)
        assert len(factors) > 0
        for i in range(len(factors)):
            for j in range(i+1, len(factors)):
                assert factors[i] != factors[j]

    @given(strategies.integers(min_value=1))
    def property_2(n):
        factors = candidate_function(n)
        product = 1
        for factor in factors:
            product *= factor
        assert product == n

    return [property_1, property_2]
```
This test suite checks two properties:

1. The function returns a list of factors, where each factor is a positive integer.
2. The product of the factors is equal to the input number.

The test suite is written using the `@given` decorator from the Hypothesis library, which generates random test cases based on the given strategies. In this case, the strategies are `strategies.integers(min_value=1)`, which generates random positive integers, and `strategies.lists(strategies.integers(min_value=1), min_size=1)`, which generates random lists of positive integers with at least one element.

The test suite consists of two property tests, `property_1` and `property_2`, which are defined as functions with the `@given` decorator. The first property test checks that the function returns a list of factors, where each factor is a positive integer, and the second property test checks that the product of the factors is equal to the input number.

The test suite can be run using the `hypothesis` library by calling the `property_test` function with the hypothetical solution function as an argument:
```
property_test(solution)
```
This will run the test suite and report any errors or failures.</s>  ```

This code uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes to find all prime factors of a given integer. It starts by iterating over the range of numbers from 2 to the square root of the input number, and for each number, it checks if it is a factor of the input number by dividing it by the number and checking if the result is equal to 0. If it is, it adds the factor to a list and divides the input number by the factor until the factor is no longer a factor of the input number. Finally, it returns the list of prime factors.

Here's an example of how to use the function:
```
print(prime_factors(12)) # Output: [2, 2, 3]
print(prime_factors(15)) # Output: [3, 5]
print(prime_factors(24)) # Output: [2, 2, 2, 3]
```
This code will work for any positive integer input.</s>  ```

This code uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes to find all prime factors of a given integer `n`. The algorithm starts by iteratively dividing `n` by the smallest prime number, 2, and adding 2 to the list of prime factors until it is no longer divisible by 2. Then, it moves on to the next prime number, 3, and continues this process until the square root of `n` is reached. If `n` is not equal to 1 at the end of the process, it is added to the list of prime factors.

Here is an example of how this function would work for the input `n = 120`:
```
>>> get_prime_factors(120)
[2, 2, 2, 3, 5]
```
This output shows that 120 can be factored as 2^3 \* 3 \* 5, which corresponds to the list of prime factors returned by the function.</s>  ```

This code uses the trial division method to find the prime factors of a given integer `n`. It first checks if `n` is even and repeatedly divides it by 2 while it is even, adding 2 to the list of factors. Then it iterates over the odd numbers up to the square root of `n`, and for each number that divides `n` without leaving a remainder, it adds that number to the list of factors and divides `n` by that number. Finally, if `n` is not equal to 1, it adds the remaining factor to the list.

Here's an explanation of how the code works:

1. `while n % 2 == 0`: This checks if `n` is even. If it is, it repeatedly divides `n` by 2 and adds 2 to the list of factors until `n` is no longer even.
2. `for i in range(3, int(math.sqrt(n))+1, 2)`: This iterates over the odd numbers up to the square root of `n`.
3. `while n % i == 0`: This checks if `i` divides `n` without leaving a remainder. If it does, it adds `i` to the list of factors and divides `n` by `i`.
4. `if n > 2`: This checks if `n` is greater than 2. If it is, it adds the remaining factor to the list.

Here's an example of how the code would work for the input `n = 12`:

1. `n` is even, so we repeatedly divide it by 2 and add 2 to the list of factors until `n` is no longer even. In this case, `n` is divided by 2 three times, so we add 2 to the list of factors three times.
2. We iterate over the odd numbers up to the square root of `n`, which is 3. We check if 3 divides `n` without leaving a remainder, but it does not, so we move on to the next number.
3. We check if 5 divides `n` without leaving a remainder, but it does not, so we move on to the next number.
4. We check if 7 divides `n` without leaving a remainder, and it does, so we add 7 to the list of factors and divide `n` by 7.
5. `n` is now 1, so we add 1 to the list of factors.

The final list of prime factors is [2, 2, 2, 7, 1], which is the correct answer.</s>
