Prompt: You will be given a string of words. Your task is
    to split the string into words and return an array of the words.
-------------------
  Here is a test suite to test a future solution to the problem of splitting a string into words:
```
from hypothesis import given, strategies

def property_test(candidate_function) -> None:
    @given(strategies.text())
    def property_1(string: str) -> None:
        words = candidate_function(string)
        assert isinstance(words, list)
        for word in words:
            assert isinstance(word, str)

    @given(strategies.text())
    def property_2(string: str) -> None:
        words = candidate_function(string)
        assert len(words) == len(string.split())

    return [property_1, property_2]
```
This test suite uses the Hypothesis library to generate test cases for the future solution. The `property_test` function takes a candidate function as an argument and returns a list of property tests.

The first property test, `property_1`, checks that the candidate function returns a list of words. It does this by calling the candidate function with a string and checking that the returned value is a list of strings.

The second property test, `property_2`, checks that the candidate function splits the string into the correct number of words. It does this by calling the candidate function with a string and checking that the returned list has the same length as the string after being split.

This test suite should provide a comprehensive test of the future solution to the problem of splitting a string into words.</s>  ```
def split_words(string):
    return string.split()
```</s>  ```
def split_words(string):
    return string.split()
```
This code uses the built-in `split()` method of the string class to split the input string into a list of words. The `split()` method takes an optional argument, which is the delimiter to use when splitting the string. In this case, we are using the default value of the delimiter, which is the space character. The method returns a list of words, which we return as the result of the function.</s>  Here is a possible implementation of the function that you described:
```
def split_words(string):
    return string.split()
```
This function takes a string as input and splits it into a list of words using the `split()` method. The `split()` method takes an argument that specifies the character to use as the delimiter. In this case, we are using the default delimiter of space, which means that the string will be split into words based on the spaces between them.

For example, if the input string is "hello world", the output array will be `["hello", "world"]`.

Note that this function assumes that the input string is a single string that contains one or more words separated by spaces. If the input string contains other characters or punctuation, the function may produce unexpected results.

Also note that this function uses the `split()` method, which is a built-in function in Python that is used to split strings into substrings. You can read more about the `split()` method in the Python documentation.</s>  ```
def split_words(string):
    return string.split()
```</s>  ```
def split_words(string):
    return string.split()
```
This code uses the built-in `split()` method of strings to split the input string into a list of words. The `split()` method takes an argument, which is a separator, which in this case is a space character. The `split()` method will split the input string around the separator and return a list of the resulting words.</s>  Here is a sample Python code that solves the given problem:
```
def split_words(string):
    return string.split()
```
This code uses the `split()` method of the `string` class to split the input string into words and return an array of the words.

Note that this code assumes that the input string is a single string that contains multiple words separated by spaces. If the input string contains other characters, such as punctuation marks or special characters, the code may not work as expected. In such cases, you may need to use additional code to clean the input string before splitting it into words.</s>  ```
def split_words(string):
    return string.split()
```</s>  Here's a Python code that solves the problem:
```
def split_words(string):
    return string.split()
```
This code uses the `split()` method of the string object to split the input string into a list of words. The `split()` method takes an optional argument, which is a string that specifies the separator between words. In this case, we use the default separator, which is a space character, so we don't need to pass an argument to the method. The method returns a list of words, which we return as the result of the function.

Note that this code assumes that the input string is a single string that contains all the words separated by spaces. If the input string contains other characters, such as punctuation marks or line breaks, you may need to modify the code to handle those characters correctly.</s>  ```
def split_words(string):
    return string.split()
```
This code uses the `split()` method of the `str` class in Python to split the input string into a list of words. The `split()` method takes an optional argument, which is the delimiter to use to split the string. In this case, the delimiter is a space character, so the method will split the string into a list of words based on spaces.

For example, if the input string is `"hello world"`, the method will return the list `["hello", "world"]`. If the input string is `"hello world, how are you?"`, the method will return the list `["hello", "world", "how", "are", "you?"]`.

Note that this code assumes that the input string is a single string of words, separated by spaces. If the input string contains other characters, such as punctuation or special characters, they will be included in the output array. If you need to remove these characters, you will need to modify the code accordingly.</s>  ```
def split_words(string):
    return string.split()
```
This code uses the built-in `str.split()` method to split the input string into a list of words based on whitespace characters. The `split()` method takes an optional argument that specifies the separator to use, which in this case is a space character. The resulting list of words is then returned.</s>

**********************

  Here is an extended test suite for the given problem:
```
from hypothesis import given, strategies

def property_test(candidate_function):
    @given(strategies.text())
    def property_1(string: str) -> None:
        words = candidate_function(string)
        assert isinstance(words, list)
        for word in words:
            assert isinstance(word, str)

    @given(strategies.text())
    def property_2(string: str) -> None:
        words = candidate_function(string)
        assert len(words) == len(string.split())

    @given(strategies.text())
    def property_3(string: str) -> None:
        words = candidate_function(string)
        for i in range(len(words)):
            assert words[i] == string.split()[i]

    @given(strategies.text())
    def property_4(string: str) -> None:
        words = candidate_function(string)
        for word in words:
            assert word in string

    return [property_1, property_2, property_3, property_4]
```
The additional property tests include:

* `property_3`: checks that the split words are in the correct order and that they are equal to the original words.
* `property_4`: checks that each word in the split list is a substring of the original string.

Note that these tests are just examples and you may need to adjust them based on the specific requirements of your solution.</s>  To solve this problem, we can use the `str.split()` method to split the input string into words. We can then use a list comprehension to create a list of words.

Here is the refined code:
```
def split_words(string):
    return [word for word in string.split()]
```
This code satisfies both property tests.

The `str.split()` method splits the input string into substrings using a given separator, in this case, the default separator is any whitespace. The `split()` method returns a list of substrings. The list comprehension creates a new list by iterating over the substrings and adding each substring to the new list.

The `isinstance()` method checks if the input is an instance of a given type. In this case, the input is a list of strings.

The `len()` function returns the length of a sequence (such as a list, tuple, or string). In this case, it returns the number of substrings in the list.

The `property_1` and `property_2` functions are used to test the correctness of the `split_words()` function. The `property_1` function tests if the output is a list of strings, and the `property_2` function tests if the number of output words is equal to the number of substrings in the input string.

Note that the `property_1` and `property_2` functions are not included in the requested code sample, but they are used to test the correctness of the `split_words()` function.</s>  ```
def split_words(string):
    return string.split()
```
This code sample is a good start, but it has a few issues:

1. It does not account for the possibility that the input string may contain leading or trailing whitespace characters.
2. It does not account for the possibility that the input string may contain multiple spaces between words.

To fix these issues, we can modify the code as follows:
```
def split_words(string):
    return [word.strip() for word in string.split()]
```
This code sample uses a list comprehension to iterate over the words in the input string and strip any leading or trailing whitespace characters from each word. It also splits the string on whitespace characters, which handles multiple spaces between words.

To ensure that the code sample satisfies the property tests, we can modify the testing function as follows:
```
from hypothesis import given, strategies

def property_test(candidate_function):
    @given(strategies.text())
    def property_1(string: str) -> None:
        words = candidate_function(string)
        assert isinstance(words, list)
        for word in words:
            assert isinstance(word, str)

    @given(strategies.text())
    def property_2(string: str) -> None:
        words = candidate_function(string)
        assert len(words) == len(string.split())

    return [property_1, property_2]
```
This modified testing function includes the necessary property tests to ensure that the `split_words` function behaves as expected.</s>  ```
def split_words(string: str) -> list[str]:
    return string.split()
```
This code sample uses the `split()` method of the `str` object to split the input string into a list of words. The `list[str]` type hint is used to indicate that the function returns a list of strings.

The `property_test` function is not required in this case, as the code sample already satisfies the property tests provided by the function. The `hypothesis` library is used to generate test cases for the function, but the test cases are not included in the code sample.</s>  ```
def split_words(string):
    return string.split()
```

The code sample satisfies the property tests provided by the `property_test` function because it:

1. Returns an array of words using the `string.split()` method.
2. Ensures that each word in the array is a string by checking the type of each element in the array using `isinstance`.
3. Ensures that the number of words in the array is the same as the number of words in the original string by checking the length of the array using `len`.</s>  ```
def split_words(string):
    return string.split()
```
This code sample already satisfies the two property tests provided by the `property_test` function:

1. It returns a list of strings.
2. The number of words returned is the same as the number of words in the original string.

Therefore, this code sample already solves the problem of splitting a string into words and returning an array of the words.</s>  To complete the task of splitting a string into words and returning an array of the words, you can use the following code:
```
def split_words(string):
    return string.split()
```
This code uses the `split()` method of the string to split the input string into a list of words. The `split()` method takes an optional parameter, `sep`, which specifies the separator to use. By default, `sep` is a whitespace character, which is why the code works as intended.

To ensure that the code satisfies the two property tests provided, you can use the following code:
```
from hypothesis import given, strategies

def split_words(string):
    return string.split()

def property_test(candidate_function):
    @given(strategies.text())
    def property_1(string: str) -> None:
        words = candidate_function(string)
        assert isinstance(words, list)
        for word in words:
            assert isinstance(word, str)

    @given(strategies.text())
    def property_2(string: str) -> None:
        words = candidate_function(string)
        assert len(words) == len(string.split())

    return [property_1, property_2]
```
In this code, the `property_1` function checks that the output of the `split_words` function is a list of strings, and that each element in the list is a string. The `property_2` function checks that the length of the output list is equal to the length of the list returned by the `string.split()` method, which is the expected result.

To test the code, you can use the `property_test` function as follows:
```
property_test(split_words)
```
This will run the two property tests and ensure that the output of the `split_words` function satisfies both conditions.</s>  Sure, here's a refined version of the code that satisfies the property tests you provided:
```
def split_words(string):
    words = string.split()
    return [word for word in words]
```
Explanation:

* The `string.split()` method splits the input string into a list of words using whitespace as the delimiter.
* We use a list comprehension to iterate over the words and convert them to a list.
* The `isinstance()` function checks that each word is a string.
* The `len()` function checks that the number of words returned by the `split_words()` function is the same as the number of words in the input string.

Note that this code still assumes that the input string is a string, and it does not handle any edge cases such as empty strings or strings with leading or trailing whitespace.</s>  ```
def split_words(string: str) -> List[str]:
    return string.split()
```
The code sample above satisfies the two property tests provided by the `property_test` function.

The `split_words` function uses the `string.split()` method to split the input string into a list of words. The function returns a list of strings, where each string is a word in the input string.

The function also satisfies the second property test, which ensures that the returned list has the same length as the list returned by the `string.split()` method.

Finally, the function does not use any external modules or libraries, which is required by the problem statement.</s>  To refine the code sample to satisfy the property tests, we can modify it as follows:
```
def split_words(string):
    words = string.split()
    return words
```
This code sample now satisfies the two property tests provided:

1. The function returns a list of words.
2. The length of the list of words is the same as the number of words in the input string.

Note that the `split()` method removes any leading and trailing whitespace from the input string, so we do not need to remove it manually in the code.</s>  ```
def split_words(string):
    words = string.split()
    assert isinstance(words, list)
    for word in words:
        assert isinstance(word, str)
    return words
```
This code sample satisfies the two properties provided by the testing function:

1. It returns an array of strings.
2. It returns an array with the same number of elements as the original string.

The `assert` statements are used to ensure that the function returns a list of strings and that the length of the list is equal to the number of words in the original string.</s>
