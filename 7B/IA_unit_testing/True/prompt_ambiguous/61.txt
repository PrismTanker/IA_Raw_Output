    }
}
```
This test suite includes several tests to check if the solution works correctly with different inputs, including empty strings, strings with missing or extra closing brackets, strings with nested brackets, and strings with unbalanced nested brackets. The expected output for each test is either true or false, indicating whether the opening brackets in the input string have corresponding closing brackets.</s>  ```
def is_balanced_brackets(expression):
    stack = []
    for char in expression:
        if char == '(':
            stack.append(char)
        elif char == ')':
            if not stack:
                return False
            stack.pop()
    return not stack
```</s>  Sure, here is a solution to the problem:
```
def is_balanced(s):
    stack = []
    for char in s:
        if char == '(':
            stack.append(char)
        elif char == ')':
            if not stack:
                return False
            stack.pop()
    return not stack
```
This code uses a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets. When it encounters a closing bracket, it checks if the stack is empty. If it is, then there is a mismatch. If not, it pops the last element off the stack, which is the corresponding opening bracket.

Here's an example usage of this function:
```
s = "(()())"
print(is_balanced(s))  # Output: True

s = "((())"
print(is_balanced(s))  # Output: False
```
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.</s>  To check if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, you can use a stack data structure. The idea is to push opening brackets onto the stack, and whenever you encounter a closing bracket, pop the last element from the stack and compare it with the closing bracket. If the brackets match, you're good. If not, it means that there is a mismatch and you should return False.

Here's some sample Python code that implements this approach:
```
def is_balanced(s):
    stack = []
    for char in s:
        if char == "{" or char == "[" or char == "(":
            stack.append(char)
        elif char == "}" or char == "]" or char == ")":
            if len(stack) == 0:
                return False
            stack.pop()
    if len(stack) == 0:
        return True
    else:
        return False
```
This code uses a list to store the opening brackets and pops them from the list as it encounters closing brackets. If the stack is empty at the end of the string, it means that every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, and the function returns True. Otherwise, it means that there is a mismatch, and the function returns False.

Note that this code assumes that the input string only contains the following characters: "{", "}", "[", "]", "(" and ")". If your input string can contain other characters, you'll need to modify the code accordingly.</s>  ```
def is_balanced(expression):
    stack = []
    for char in expression:
        if char == '(':
            stack.append(char)
        elif char == ')':
            if not stack:
                return False
            stack.pop()
    return not stack
```
This code uses a stack data structure to keep track of opening brackets and ensures that every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket. The function starts by initializing an empty stack. It then iterates through the expression, adding opening brackets to the stack and popping closing brackets off the stack. If the stack is empty at the end of the iteration, the expression is balanced. Otherwise, it is not balanced.</s>  ```
def check_brackets(expression):
    stack = []
    for char in expression:
        if char == '(':
            stack.append(char)
        elif char == ')':
            if not stack:
                return False
            stack.pop()
    return not stack
```
This code uses a stack to keep track of the opening brackets and then checks if every closing bracket has a corresponding opening bracket. If there is a closing bracket with no corresponding opening bracket, the function returns False. If all closing brackets have a corresponding opening bracket, the function returns True.</s>  Here's a Python code to check if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket:
```python
def is_balanced(s):
    stack = []
    for c in s:
        if c == '(':
            stack.append(c)
        elif c == ')':
            if not stack:
                return False
            stack.pop()
    return not stack
```
This code uses a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets. For every opening bracket, we push it onto the stack. For every closing bracket, we pop the topmost opening bracket from the stack. If the stack is empty at the end, it means that every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket.

The `is_balanced` function takes a string `s` as input, and returns `True` if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, and `False` otherwise.

You can test this function with the following test cases:
```python
assert is_balanced("()") == True
assert is_balanced("(())") == True
assert is_balanced("(()") == False
assert is_balanced("((())") == False
```
In the first test case, the string `s` is `()`, which has no opening brackets, and so the function returns `True`.

In the second test case, the string `s` is `()`, which has no opening brackets, and so the function returns `True`.

In the third test case, the string `s` is `(()`, which has one opening bracket but no corresponding closing bracket, and so the function returns `False`.

In the fourth test case, the string `s` is `((()`, which has two opening brackets but no corresponding closing bracket, and so the function returns `False`.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.</s>  ```
def is_balanced_brackets(expression):
    stack = []
    for char in expression:
        if char == '(':
            stack.append(char)
        elif char == ')':
            if not stack:
                return False
            stack.pop()
    return not stack
```
This code uses a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets. It loops through each character in the expression and if it's an opening bracket, it adds it to the stack. If it's a closing bracket, it checks if the stack is empty. If it is, it returns False. Otherwise, it pops the top element from the stack. If the stack is empty at the end of the loop, it means that every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket and the expression is balanced. The function returns True in this case.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the expression, because the loop iterates through each character in the expression once. The space complexity is O(n), because the stack has a maximum size of n, which is the number of opening brackets in the expression.

Note that this solution assumes that the expression only contains opening and closing brackets. If the expression contains other characters, this solution will fail.</s>  ```

            stack.pop()
    return not stack
```
This code uses a stack data structure to keep track of opening brackets. Every time it encounters an opening bracket, it pushes it onto the stack. When it encounters a closing bracket, it checks if the stack is empty. If it is, then there is a mismatch in brackets and the function returns False. If the stack is not empty, then there are still opening brackets that need to be closed, so the function pops the top element off the stack and continues checking the remaining characters. If the stack is empty at the end of the loop, then there are no mismatched brackets, so the function returns True.</s>  ```
def is_balanced_brackets(expression):
    stack = []
    for char in expression:
        if char in ["(", "{", "["]:
            stack.append(char)
        elif char in [")", "}", "]"]:
            if not stack:
                return False
            top = stack.pop()
            if not matches(top, char):
                return False
    return not stack

def matches(opening, closing):
    return {
        "(": ")",
        "{": "}",
        "[": "]"
    }[opening] == closing
```
This code uses a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets. When it encounters a closing bracket, it checks if there is a corresponding opening bracket in the stack. If there is not, it returns `False`. If there is, it pops the opening bracket from the stack and checks if it matches the closing bracket. If it does not match, it returns `False`. If it does match, it continues until the end of the expression. If the stack is empty at the end of the expression, it returns `True`.

Note that this code assumes that the expression only contains the following three brackets: `(`, `)`, and `{}`. If the expression can contain other brackets, you will need to modify the code accordingly.</s>  ```
def is_balanced_parenthesis(string):
    stack = []
    for char in string:
        if char == "(":
            stack.append(char)
        elif char == ")":
            if len(stack) == 0:
                return False
            stack.pop()
    return len(stack) == 0
```
This code uses a stack to keep track of the opening brackets and ensures that every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket. It uses the `append` and `pop` methods of the `stack` to add and remove elements from the stack, respectively. Finally, it returns `True` if the stack is empty, which means that all opening brackets have been matched with a closing bracket.

Here's an example of how to use this function:
```
string = "(((a+b)*(c+d))+e)"
print(is_balanced_parenthesis(string)) # Output: True

string = "(((a+b)*(c+d))+e)("
print(is_balanced_parenthesis(string)) # Output: False
