  Here is a test suite for the `factorize` function using the Hypothesis library:
```
from hypothesis import given, strategies

def property_test(candidate_function):

    @given(strategies.integers(0, 100))
    def property_1(n):
        # Check that the function returns a list of integers
        assert isinstance(candidate_function(n), list)
        assert all(isinstance(x, int) for x in candidate_function(n))

    @given(strategies.integers(0, 100))
    def property_2(n):
        # Check that the product of all factors is equal to the input number
        factors = candidate_function(n)
        assert n == sum(factors)

    @given(strategies.integers(0, 100))
    def property_3(n):
        # Check that each factor appears the correct number of times
        factors = candidate_function(n)
        for factor in factors:
            assert factors.count(factor) == n // factor

    return [property_1, property_2, property_3]
```
This test suite has three properties:

1. `property_1`: Checks that the function returns a list of integers and that each element in the list is an integer.
2. `property_2`: Checks that the product of all factors is equal to the input number.
3. `property_3`: Checks that each factor appears the correct number of times.

The `given` decorator is used to generate random integers between 0 and 100 for the test inputs. The `strategies` module is used to generate random integers that are likely to be prime factors of the input number.</s>  Here's a Python function that uses the Euclidean algorithm to factorize an integer:
```
from typing import List

def factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:
    factors: List[int] = []
    while n > 1:
        for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
            if n % i == 0:
                factors.append(i)
                n //= i
                break
        else:
            factors.append(n)
            n = 1
    return factors
```
This function uses a while loop to repeatedly divide the input `n` by the smallest factor it can find until it reaches 1. The `for` loop checks for divisibility by each number from 2 to the square root of `n`, and the `else` clause is executed when the `for` loop completes without finding a divisor. In that case, the remaining number is added to the list of factors and the process is repeated with the new value of `n`.

The `factorize` function returns a list of prime factors of the input integer in the order from smallest to largest, with each factor listed the number of times it appears in the factorization. The input number should be equal to the product of all factors.

For example,
```
print(factorize(8))  # [2, 2, 2]
print(factorize(25))  # [5, 5]
print(factorize(70))  # [2, 5, 7]
```
Note that this function uses the Euclidean algorithm to factorize the input integer, which is more efficient than trial division for large numbers. However, the function is not the fastest possible implementation, as it has a time complexity of O(n^0.5) where n is the input integer.</s>  def factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:
