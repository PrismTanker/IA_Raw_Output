Prompt: In this task, you will be given a string that represents a number of apples and oranges 
    that are distributed in a basket of fruit this basket contains 
    apples, oranges, and mango fruits. Given the string that represents the total number of 
    the oranges and apples and the total number of the fruits 
    in the basket return the number of the mango fruits in the basket.
    for examble:
    fruit_distribution("5 apples and 6 oranges", 19) ->19 - 5 - 6 = 8
    fruit_distribution("0 apples and 1 oranges",3) -> 3 - 0 - 1 = 2
    fruit_distribution("2 apples and 3 oranges", 100) -> 100 - 2 - 3 = 95
    fruit_distribution("100 apples and 1 oranges",120) -> 120 - 100 - 1 = 19
-------------------
  Here's a test suite for the `fruit_distribution` function:
```
{
    "tests": [
        {
            "name": "basic_test",
            "in": {
                "fruit_string": "5 apples and 6 oranges",
                "total_fruits": 19
            },
            "out": 8
        },
        {
            "name": "zero_apples",
            "in": {
                "fruit_string": "0 apples and 1 oranges",
                "total_fruits": 3
            },
            "out": 2
        },
        {
            "name": "zero_oranges",
            "in": {
                "fruit_string": "2 apples and 0 oranges",
                "total_fruits": 100
            },
            "out": 98
        },
        {
            "name": "zero_fruits",
            "in": {
                "fruit_string": "0 apples and 0 oranges",
                "total_fruits": 0
            },
            "out": 0
        },
        {
            "name": "invalid_string",
            "in": {
                "fruit_string": "100 apples and 1 oranges",
                "total_fruits": 120
            },
            "out": 19
        }
    ]
}
```
This test suite covers the following cases:

* Basic case: `fruit_distribution("5 apples and 6 oranges", 19)`
* Zero apples: `fruit_distribution("0 apples and 1 oranges", 3)`
* Zero oranges: `fruit_distribution("2 apples and 0 oranges", 100)`
* Zero fruits: `fruit_distribution("0 apples and 0 oranges", 0)`
* Invalid string: `fruit_distribution("100 apples and 1 oranges", 120)`

Note that the `out` field in each test case represents the expected output for the given input.</s>  ```

This function takes in two parameters: `fruit_string` which is a string representing the distribution of apples and oranges in the basket, and `total_fruits` which is the total number of fruits in the basket.

The function first splits the `fruit_string` into a list of strings using the `split()` method with the delimiter " and ". This gives us a list of strings containing the number of apples and oranges.

We then convert the first element of the list (the number of apples) and the second element of the list (the number of oranges) to integers using the `int()` function.

We then calculate the number of mango fruits by subtracting the number of apples and oranges from the total number of fruits.

Finally, we return the number of mango fruits.</s>  ```

    fruit_list = fruit_string.split(" and ")

    orange_count = int(fruit_list[1].split(" ")[0])
    mango_count = total_fruits - apple_count - orange_count
    return mango_count
```
This code uses the `split` method to extract the number of apples and oranges from the input string, and then calculates the number of mango fruits by subtracting the total number of fruits from the sum of the apple and orange counts.</s>  ```
def fruit_distribution(fruit_string, total_fruits):
    fruit_list = fruit_string.split(" and ")
    apple_count = int(fruit_list[0].split(" ")[0])
    orange_count = int(fruit_list[1].split(" ")[0])
    mango_count = total_fruits - apple_count - orange_count
    return mango_count
```
Note that this solution assumes that the input string will always be in the format "X apples and Y oranges", where X and Y are integers representing the number of apples and oranges, respectively. If the input string is in a different format, the solution will need to be modified accordingly.</s>  ```
def fruit_distribution(fruit_string, total_fruits):
    fruit_dict = {}
    for fruit in fruit_string.split(" and "):
        fruit_name, fruit_count = fruit.split(" ")
        fruit_dict[fruit_name] = int(fruit_count)
    total_apples = fruit_dict["apples"]
    total_oranges = fruit_dict["oranges"]
    total_mangoes = total_fruits - total_apples - total_oranges
    return total_mangoes
```
This function takes in two parameters: `fruit_string` and `total_fruits`. It first splits the `fruit_string` into a list of fruits and their counts using the `split()` method. It then creates a dictionary called `fruit_dict` to store the counts of each fruit.

Next, it extracts the counts of apples and oranges from the dictionary using the fruit names as keys. It then calculates the total number of mangoes by subtracting the total number of apples and oranges from the total number of fruits.

Finally, it returns the total number of mangoes.

Note that this function assumes that the `fruit_string` is in the format "X apples and Y oranges" where X and Y are the counts of apples and oranges, respectively. If the `fruit_string` is in a different format, the function may not work correctly.</s>  ```

The function takes two arguments: `fruit_string` which is a string representing the distribution of apples and oranges in the basket, and `total_fruits` which is the total number of fruits in the basket.

The function first splits the `fruit_string` into a list of strings using the `split()` method, and then converts the first and third elements of the list to integers using the `int()` function. These integers represent the number of apples and oranges respectively.

The function then calculates the number of mango fruits in the basket by subtracting the number of apples and oranges from the total number of fruits.

The function returns the number of mango fruits in the basket.

Here are a few examples of how the function can be used:
```
print(fruit_distribution("5 apples and 6 oranges", 19)) # Output: 8
print(fruit_distribution("0 apples and 1 oranges", 3)) # Output: 2
print(fruit_distribution("2 apples and 3 oranges", 100)) # Output: 95
print(fruit_distribution("100 apples and 1 oranges", 120)) # Output: 19
