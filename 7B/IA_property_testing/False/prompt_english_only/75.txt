Prompt: Write a function that returns true if the given number is the multiplication of 3 prime numbers
    and false otherwise.
-------------------
  Here's a test suite that you can use to test a future solution to the problem:
```
from hypothesis import given, strategies

def property_test(candidate_function):
    @given(strategies.integers())
    def property_1(n):
        assert candidate_function(n) == (n % 3 == 0 and candidate_function(n // 3) and candidate_function(n // 3 * 2))

    @given(strategies.integers())
    def property_2(n):
        assert not candidate_function(n) == (n % 3 != 0 and not candidate_function(n // 3) and not candidate_function(n // 3 * 2))

    return [property_1, property_2]
```
This test suite uses the Hypothesis library to generate random integers and test the candidate function with different inputs. It defines two property tests:

* `property_1`: Tests that the function returns `True` when the input is the multiplication of three prime numbers.
* `property_2`: Tests that the function returns `False` when the input is not the multiplication of three prime numbers.

The test suite returns a list containing the two property tests. You can use this test suite to test your future solution to the problem.</s>  ```

Explanation:

This function checks if the given number `n` is the product of 3 prime numbers by iterating from 2 to the square root of `n`. If any number `i` divides `n`, it means that `n` is not the product of 3 prime numbers. If no number divides `n`, it means that `n` is the product of 3 prime numbers.

For example, if `n = 6`, the function will iterate from 2 to 3, and since 2 and 3 are prime, the function will return `True`. If `n = 12`, the function will iterate from 2 to 4, and since 2, 3, and 4 are not prime, the function will return `False`.</s>  def is_multiple_of_three_prime_numbers(n):

        if i % 3 == 0:

Explanation:

The function first checks if the given number is less than or equal to 2, as the product of 3 prime numbers cannot be less than 6. If the number is less than or equal to 2, the function returns False.

Next, the function iterates from 3 to the square root of the given number, checking if the number is divisible by any number in the range. If the number is divisible by any number in the range, it means that it is not the product of 3 prime numbers, and the function returns False.

If the number is not divisible by any number in the range, it means that it is the product of 3 prime numbers, and the function returns True.

Note: The function uses the fact that the product of 3 prime numbers is always greater than 6, and that the square root of a number is the largest integer that divides the number. This allows the function to efficiently check if a number is the product of 3 prime numbers.</s>  ```

    if n == 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0 and is_prime(i) and is_prime(n // i):
            return True
    return False

def is_prime(n):
    if n <= 1 or n % 2 == 0:
        return False
    for i in range(3, int(n ** 0.5) + 1, 2):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```
This code first checks if the given number is 1, as 1 is not the multiplication of 3 prime numbers. If it is not 1, it iterates through the numbers from 2 to the square root of the given number, checking if it is a factor of the number. If it is a factor, it checks if it is a prime number using a separate function. If it is a prime number, it checks if the other two prime numbers are also factors of the number. If it is the multiplication of 3 prime numbers, the function returns true, otherwise it returns false.

The is_prime function checks if a number is prime by iterating through the numbers from 3 to the square root of the number, checking if the number is divisible by any of them. If it is not divisible by any of them, it is prime.

This code uses the math module to calculate the square root of a number.</s>  ```
def is_multiple_of_3_prime_numbers(n):
    if n == 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```
This function uses the fact that if a number is the product of three prime numbers, it must be divisible by one of the prime factors. It then checks if the number is divisible by any of the prime factors by iterating from 2 to the square root of the number and returning false if it is divisible. If the number is not divisible by any of the prime factors, it must be the product of three prime numbers and the function returns true.</s>  ```
def is_multiple_of_3_primes(n):
    if n == 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0 and is_prime(i) and is_prime(n // i):
            return True
    return False

def is_prime(n):
    if n <= 1 or n % 2 == 0:
        return False
    for i in range(3, int(n ** 0.5) + 1, 2):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```
This function first checks if the number is 1, which is not a valid case. If the number is not 1, it checks if it is a multiple of 3 prime numbers by iterating through all the prime numbers up to the square root of the number and checking if the number is divisible by any of them. If it is divisible by a prime number, it checks if the other two prime numbers are also divisible by the number. If all the conditions are met, the function returns True, otherwise it returns False.

Note that the function is using the Sieve of Eratosthenes to find the prime numbers up to the square root of the number, which is an efficient algorithm to find all the prime numbers up to a certain number.</s>  ```
def is_multiple_of_3_prime_numbers(n):
    for i in range(3):
        if n % i != 0:
            return False
    return True
```
This function iterates over the range of numbers from 3 to n, and checks if each number is a factor of n. If any number is not a factor, the function returns False. If all numbers are factors, the function returns True.

The function uses the modulo operator (%) to check if a number is a factor of another number. If the remainder is 0, the two numbers are factors.

The function uses a for loop to iterate over the range of numbers from 3 to n, and a nested if statement to check if each number is a factor of n.

The function does not use any modules, and does not import any external libraries.

Note: The function assumes that the input number is a positive integer. If the input number is a negative integer, the function will return False.</s>  ```
def is_multiplication_of_3_prime_numbers(n):
    if n == 1:
        return False

    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            continue

        j = n // i
        k = j * i
        if k == n:
            return True

    return False
```
This function first checks if the given number is equal to 1, as 1 is not the multiplication of 3 prime numbers. If the number is not equal to 1, it loops through all numbers from 2 to the square root of the given number, and for each number, it checks if the number is a factor of the given number. If the number is a factor, it divides the number by the factor and checks if the result is equal to the given number. If the result is equal to the given number, it returns True, otherwise it continues to the next number. If the loop completes without returning True, it returns False.

This function uses the % operator to check if a number is a factor of another number, and the // operator to divide a number by another number. It also uses the int() function to convert a float to an integer, and the ** operator to raise a number to a power.</s>  ```
def is_multiple_of_3_prime_numbers(n):
    if n == 1:
        return False

        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```</s>  Here is a sample Python code that solves the problem:
```
def is_multiple_of_3_prime_numbers(n):
    if n <= 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0 and is_prime(i) and is_prime(n // i):
            return True
    return False

def is_prime(n):
    if n <= 1 or n % 2 == 0:
        return False
    for i in range(3, int(n ** 0.5) + 1, 2):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```
This code uses the `is_prime` function to check if a number is prime, and the `is_multiple_of_3_prime_numbers` function to check if a number is the multiplication of 3 prime numbers. The `is_prime` function is based on the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm, which is an efficient method for finding prime numbers up to a given number. The `is_multiple_of_3_prime_numbers` function checks if a number is the multiplication of 3 prime numbers by iterating over the factors of the number and checking if each factor is a prime number.

The `is_multiple_of_3_prime_numbers` function takes a single argument `n`, which is the number to be checked. It returns `True` if the number is the multiplication of 3 prime numbers, and `False` otherwise.

The `is_prime` function takes a single argument `n`, which is the number to be checked. It returns `True` if the number is prime, and `False` otherwise.

You can test the code with the following test cases:
```
assert is_multiple_of_3_prime_numbers(12) == True
assert is_multiple_of_3_prime_numbers(15) == False
assert is_multiple_of_3_prime_numbers(24) == True
```
Note that the `assert` statements are used to test the code with different input values and expected output values.</s>
