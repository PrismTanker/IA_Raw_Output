    to split the string into words and return an array of the words.

    },

    }
}</s>  Here is a test suite for the given problem:
```
{
    "split_words_test": {
        "in": {
            "words": "hello world how are you"
        },
        "out": ["hello", "world", "how", "are", "you"]
    }
}
```
This test suite includes one test case, where the input string is "hello world how are you". The expected output is an array of words that matches the expected output.

Note that the input and output are both in JSON format. The input is a JSON object with a single key-value pair, where the key is "words" and the value is a string of words. The output is also a JSON object with a single key-value pair, where the key is "out" and the value is an array of words.

This test suite is designed to test the ability of a future solution to split a string into an array of words. It includes a single test case that demonstrates the expected output for a given input string.</s>  ```
def split_words(string):
    return string.split()
```</s>  ```
def split_words(string):
    return string.split()
```
This code uses the `split()` method of the `str` class to split the string into words based on whitespace characters. The `split()` method returns a list of words, which is then returned by the function.</s>  ```
def split_words(string):
    return string.split()
```
This code uses the built-in `split()` method of the `str` class to split the input string into words. The `split()` method takes an optional argument, which is the character to split the string by. In this case, we are splitting the string by spaces, so we pass in an empty string (`''`) as the argument.

For example, if we have the following string:
```
'Hello World'
```
We can split it into an array of words using the `split_words()` function:
```
words = split_words('Hello World')
print(words)
```
This will output:
```
['Hello', 'World']
```
Note that the `split_words()` function will also remove any whitespace characters from the beginning and end of the string before splitting it. For example, if we have the following string:
```
'   Hello World  '
```
We can split it into an array of words using the `split_words()` function:
```
words = split_words('   Hello World  ')
print(words)
```
This will output:
```
['Hello', 'World']
```
Note that the `split_words()` function will also remove any whitespace characters from the beginning and end of the string before splitting it.</s>  ```
def split_words(string):
    return string.split()
```
This code uses the `split()` method of the string class to split the input string into a list of words. The `split()` method takes an optional argument that specifies the character(s) to use for splitting the string. In this case, we are using the default argument, which is a space character (` `), so the method will split the string at each space.

For example, if the input string is `"hello world"`, the method will return `["hello", "world"]`.

Note that this code will not work if the input string contains any other characters that are not spaces, such as tabs or newlines. If you need to handle input strings with these characters, you will need to modify the code accordingly.</s>  ```
def split_words(words_string):
    return words_string.split()
```
This code uses the `str.split()` method to split the input string into a list of words. The `split()` method takes an optional argument that specifies the separator to use when splitting the string. In this case, the separator is a space character, so the method will split the string into a list of words.

For example, if the input string is `"hello world"`, the output array would be `["hello", "world"]`.

Note that the `split()` method returns a list of strings, so the output array will be a list of strings. If you want to split the string into a list of lists, where each list contains a single word, you can use the `split()` method with an argument that specifies the separator. For example, to split the input string into a list of lists, where each list contains a single word, you can use the following code:
```
def split_words(words_string):
    return [words_string.split(sep=' ') for words_string in words_string]
```
This code uses a list comprehension to create a list of lists, where each list contains a single word. The `split()` method is used to split the input string into a list of words, and the `sep` argument is used to specify the separator to use when splitting the string. The resulting list of lists is returned by the function.</s>  ```
def split_words(string):
    return string.split()
```
This code uses the `split()` method of the `str` class to split the input string into a list of words. The `split()` method takes an optional argument `sep` that specifies the separator to use. In this case, we are using the default separator, which is whitespace.

For example, if the input string is `"hello world"`, the output will be `["hello", "world"]`.</s>  ```
def split_words(string):
    return string.split()
```
This code uses the built-in `split()` method of the `str` class in Python to split the input `string` into an array of words. The `split()` method takes an optional argument `sep` that specifies the separator to use for splitting the string. In this case, we are using the default separator of whitespace, so the `sep` argument is not specified. The `split()` method returns an array of words, which is what we return from the function.</s>  ```
def split_words(string):
    return string.split()
```
Explanation:

The `split()` method is a built-in method in Python that is used to split a string into a list of words. It takes a single argument, which is the separator that is used to split the string. In this case, we are using the default separator, which is a space character. The `split()` method returns a list of words, where each word is a separate element in the list.

For example, if we have the string `"hello world"`, the `split()` method would return the list `['hello', 'world']`.

We can use this method to solve the given problem by passing the string of words to the `split()` method, and then returning the resulting list of words.</s>  ```
def split_words(string):
    return string.split()
```
This code uses the `split()` method of the `str` class to split the string into words and return an array of the words. The `split()` method takes an optional argument that specifies the character(s) to use for splitting the string. In this case, we are using the default value of `None`, which means that the string will be split using whitespace characters (spaces, tabs, and line breaks).</s>  ```
def split_words(string):
    return string.split()
```
This code uses the built-in `split()` method of strings to split the input string into words and return an array of words.</s>
