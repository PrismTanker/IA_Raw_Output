Prompt: You'll be given a string of words, and your task is to count the number
    of boredoms. A boredom is a sentence that starts with the word "I".
    Sentences are delimited by '.', '?' or '!'.

import re

def count_boredom(sentence):
    pattern = r"I\b"
    return len(re.findall(pattern, sentence))
```
This code uses the `re` module to search for the pattern "I" at the beginning of a word using the `\b` word boundary anchor. The `len` function is then used to count the number of matches found in the input string.</s>  ```
import re

def count_boredom(text):
    # Split the text into individual sentences
    sentences = re.split(r'[.?!]', text)

    # Count the number of sentences that start with "I"
    count = 0
    for sentence in sentences:
        if sentence.startswith("I"):
            count += 1

    return count
```</s>  ```
import re

def count_boredom(sentence):
    # Split the sentence into individual words
    words = sentence.split()

    # Initialize a counter for boredoms
    boredom_count = 0

    # Iterate through the words and check if the word is "I"
    for word in words:
        if word == "I":
            boredom_count += 1

    return boredom_count
```

This code uses the `re` module to split the sentence into individual words, and then iterates through the words to check if the word is "I". If it is, the counter is incremented. The function returns the final count of boredoms.

Here is an example of how you can use this function:
```
sentence = "I am bored. I am bored. I am bored."
print(count_boredom(sentence))  # Output: 3
```
This code will print `3`, indicating that there are three boredoms in the sentence.</s>  ```
import re

def count_boredom(sentence):
    # Split the sentence into individual words
    words = sentence.split()
    
    # Initialize a counter for boredoms
    boredom_count = 0
    
    # Iterate over the words and check if the word is "I"
    for word in words:
        if word == "I":
            # If the word is "I", increment the boredom counter
            boredom_count += 1
    
    # Return the number of boredoms
    return boredom_count
```
Here's an example usage:
```
sentence = "I am bored. I am also bored. I am bored. I am not bored."
print(count_boredom(sentence)) # Should print 3
```</s>  ```
import re

def count_boredom(sentence):
    # Split the sentence into individual words
    words = sentence.split()
    
    # Initialize a counter for boredoms
    boredom_count = 0
    
    # Iterate through the words and check if the current word is "I"
    for word in words:
        if word == "I":
            boredom_count += 1
    
    # Return the count of boredoms
    return boredom_count
```
This code uses the `split()` method to split the input string into individual words, and then iterates through the words to count the number of times the word "I" appears. The `re` module is not used in this code.

Note that this code assumes that the input string is a sentence, and that sentences are delimited by '.', '?' or '!'. If the input string is a list of words, the code will need to be modified accordingly.</s>  ```
import re

def count_boredom(text):
    return len(re.findall(r"I\s", text))
```
For example:
```
print(count_boredom("I am bored. I am bored. I am bored."))  # 3
print(count_boredom("I am bored. I am not bored. I am bored."))  # 2
print(count_boredom("I am not bored. I am not bored. I am not bored."))  # 0
```</s>  ```
import re

def count_boredom(string):
    sentences = re.split(r'[.?!]', string)
    boredoms = 0
    for sentence in sentences:
        if sentence.startswith('I'):
            boredoms += 1
    return boredoms
```
This code uses the `re` module to split the input string into sentences, and then loops through each sentence to check if it starts with the word "I". If it does, the boredom count is incremented. The final boredom count is returned.

For example:
```
print(count_boredom("I am bored. I am also bored. I am very bored."))  # Output: 3
print(count_boredom("I am not bored. I am excited. I am very excited."))  # Output: 0
```</s>  ```
import re

def count_boredom(string):
    # Split the string into sentences
    sentences = re.split(r'[.?!]', string)

    # Initialize the counter
    count = 0

    # Iterate through the sentences
    for sentence in sentences:
        # Check if the sentence starts with "I"
        if sentence.startswith("I"):
            count += 1

    return count
```</s>  ```
import re

def count_boredoms(sentences):
    # Split the sentences into a list of individual sentences
    sentences = sentences.split(".")

    # Initialize a counter for the number of boredoms
    num_boredoms = 0

    # Iterate over the sentences and count the number of boredoms
    for sentence in sentences:
        # Check if the sentence starts with "I"
        if sentence.startswith("I"):
            num_boredoms += 1

    # Return the number of boredoms
    return num_boredoms
```
Here's an example usage of the function:
```
>>> sentences = "I am bored. I am also bored. I am really bored."
>>> count_boredoms(sentences)
3
```</s>  ```
import re

def count_boredom(sentence):
    # Split the sentence into individual words
    words = sentence.split()
    # Initialize a counter for boredoms
    boredom_count = 0
    # Iterate over the words and check if they start with "I"
    for word in words:
        if word.startswith("I"):
            boredom_count += 1
    # Return the count of boredoms
    return boredom_count

# Test the function
print(count_boredom("I am bored. You are bored. He is bored."))  # Should print 3
print(count_boredom("I am not bored. You are not bored. He is not bored."))  # Should print 0
print(count_boredom("I am bored. You are bored. He is bored! I am bored."))  # Should print 4
```
In this code, we first import the `re` module, which provides regular expression functions. We then define a function `count_boredom` that takes a string of words as input and returns the count of boredoms.

We split the sentence into individual words using the `split` method, and initialize a counter for boredoms. We then iterate over the words and check if they start with "I" using the `startswith` method. If a word starts with "I", we increment the boredom counter.

Finally, we return the count of boredoms. We test the function with three different sentences and print the result.</s>
