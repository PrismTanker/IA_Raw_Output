```
{
    "test_area_1": {
        "in": {
            "base": 3,
            "height": 4

        "out": 6
    },
    "test_area_2": {
        "in": {
            "base": 5,

        "out": 15
    },
    "test_area_3": {
        "in": {

    },
    "test_area_4": {
        "in": {
            "base": 9,
            "height": 10
        },
        "out": 45
    }
}
```
This test suite includes four tests, each with the input parameters `base` and `height` and the expected output `out`. The input values for each test are different, but the expected output is the same for each test.</s>  ```
def triangle_area(base, height):
    return (base * height) / 2
```
This code defines a function called `triangle_area` that takes two arguments: `base` and `height`. It returns the area of the triangle using the formula: `area = (base * height) / 2`.

Here's an example of how to use the function:
```
>>> triangle_area(3, 4)
6.0
```
This will return the area of a triangle with a base of 3 and a height of 4, which is 6.0.</s>  ```
def triangle_area(base, height):
    return (base * height) / 2
```
This function takes two arguments, `base` and `height`, which are the two side lengths of the triangle. The function returns the area of the triangle, which is calculated using the formula `area = (base * height) / 2`.

Here is an example of how to use the function:
```
print(triangle_area(3, 4))  # Output: 6.0
```
This will print the area of a triangle with a base of 3 and a height of 4, which is 6.0.

You can also use this function to calculate the area of a triangle with different side lengths:
```
print(triangle_area(5, 6))  # Output: 15.0
```
This will print the area of a triangle with a base of 5 and a height of 6, which is 15.0.

Note that the function assumes that the base and height are in the same units, such as both in inches or both in centimeters. If the base and height are in different units, you will need to convert one of them to the same unit as the other before calling the function.</s>  ```
def triangle_area(side_a, side_b):
    return (side_a * side_b) / 2
```
This code defines a function called `triangle_area` that takes two arguments `side_a` and `side_b`. The function returns the area of a triangle with sides of length `side_a` and `side_b`.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```
print(triangle_area(3, 4)) # prints 6.0
```
This code calls the `triangle_area` function with `side_a` equal to 3 and `side_b` equal to 4, and prints the result, which is 6.0.</s>  ```
def get_triangle_area(base: float, height: float) -> float:
    return (base * height) / 2
```
Explanation:

* The function takes two arguments: `base` and `height`, which are the lengths of the base and height of the triangle, respectively.
* The function returns the area of the triangle, which is calculated by multiplying the base and height and dividing the result by 2.

Test cases:

* `get_triangle_area(5, 6)` should return `15.0`.
* `get_triangle_area(3, 4)` should return `6.0`.
* `get_triangle_area(10, 8)` should return `20.0`.</s>  ```
def triangle_area(base, height):
    return (base * height) / 2
```

This function takes in two arguments, `base` and `height`, and returns the area of a triangle based on those two side lengths. The formula used to calculate the area is `A = (base * height) / 2`.</s>  ```
def triangle_area(base, height):
    return (base * height) / 2
```

This function takes in two parameters, `base` and `height`, and returns the area of a triangle based on these two side lengths. The formula for the area of a triangle is:

area = (base * height) / 2

This function uses the built-in `*` operator to multiply the base and height, and the `/` operator to divide by 2.

Example usage:
```
print(triangle_area(5, 6))  # Output: 15.0
```
This would return the area of a triangle with a base of 5 units and a height of 6 units, which is 15.0 square units.</s>  ```
def triangle_area(base, height):
    return (base * height) / 2
```

Explanation:

To find the area of a triangle, we need to know the base and height of the triangle. The formula for the area of a triangle is `A = (base * height) / 2`, where `A` is the area, `base` is the length of one side of the triangle, and `height` is the distance from the base to the opposite vertex.

In this code, we define a function `triangle_area` that takes two arguments, `base` and `height`, and returns the area of the triangle. We use the formula `A = (base * height) / 2` to calculate the area and return it.

Note: This code assumes that the base and height are given in the same units (e.g. both in centimeters or both in meters). If the units are different, you will need to convert one of the values to the same unit as the other before calculating the area.</s>  ```
def triangle_area(side1, side2):
    return (side1 * side2) / 2
```</s>  ```
def triangle_area(base, height):
    return (base * height) / 2
```

This code defines a function called `triangle_area` that takes two parameters: `base` and `height`. It returns the area of a triangle with the given base and height.

Here's an example usage of this function:
```
print(triangle_area(5, 6))  # Output: 15.0
```
This would return the area of a triangle with a base of 5 units and a height of 6 units, which is 15 square units.

Note that this function assumes that the input values are of the correct type (i.e., `base` and `height` are both numbers). If the input values are not numbers, the function will raise a `TypeError`.</s>  ```
def triangle_area(base, height):
    return (base * height) / 2
```</s>
