  Here's a possible test suite using the `hypothesis` library to test the `factorize` function:
```
from hypothesis import given, strategies

def property_test(candidate_function) -> None:
    @given(strategies.integers(min_value=1), strategies.integers(min_value=1))
    def property_1(n, m):
        factors = candidate_function(n)
        assert factors == sorted(set(factors))
        assert all(isinstance(factor, int) for factor in factors)
        assert all(factor >= 1 for factor in factors)
        assert len(factors) == len(set(factors))
        assert n == prod(factors)

    @given(strategies.integers(min_value=1), strategies.integers(min_value=1))
    def property_2(n, m):
        factors = candidate_function(n)
        assert all(factor in factors for factor in range(2, n+1))
        assert all(factor not in factors for factor in range(1, n+1))
        assert all(factor not in factors for factor in range(n+1, 2*n+1))

    return [property_1, property_2]
```
This test suite includes two properties:

1. The first property checks that the output of the `factorize` function is a sorted list of prime factors, where each factor is greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to `n`.
2. The second property checks that the output of the `factorize` function is a list of prime factors that contains all prime factors of `n` and does not contain any composite factors.

The test suite uses the `strategies.integers` strategy from the `hypothesis` library to generate random integers for testing the `factorize` function. The `given` decorator is used to specify the input parameters for the `factorize` function, and the `assert` statement is used to check the expected properties of the output.</s>

This function uses a simple trial division algorithm to factorize the input integer. It starts by iterating from 2 to the square root of the input number, and for each iteration, it checks if the number is divisible by the current iteration number. If it is, it appends the current iteration number to the list of factors and updates the input number by dividing it by the current iteration number. This process continues until the input number is equal to 1, which means that all the factors have been found.

Finally, the function returns the list of factors in the order from smallest to largest. Each of the factors is listed number of times corresponding to how many times it appears in the factorization.

Note that this function assumes that the input number is a positive integer. If the input number is not a positive integer, the function will raise a `TypeError`.</s>
