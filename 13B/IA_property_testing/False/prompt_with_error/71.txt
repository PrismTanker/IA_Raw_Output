Prompt: Given the lengths of the three sides of a triangle. Return the area of
    the triangle rounded to 2 decimal points if the three sides form a valid triangle. 
    Otherwise return 0
    Three sides make a valid triangle when the sum of any two sides is greater 
    than the third side.

This function takes in three sides `a`, `b`, and `c` of a triangle as input, and returns the area of the triangle rounded to 2 decimal points if the three sides form a valid triangle. If the three sides do not form a valid triangle, the function returns 0. The function uses the formula for the area of a triangle to calculate the area and rounds it to 2 decimal points using the `round()` function from the `math` module. It also uses the fact that the sum of any two sides of a triangle is greater than the third side to determine whether the sides form a valid triangle.</s>  ```

        return round(math.sqrt(p * (p - a) * (p - b) * (p - c)), 2)

        return 0

def get_triangle_area(a, b, c):
    if a + b > c and b + c > a and a + c > b:
        p = (a + b + c) / 2
        area = (p * (p - a) * (p - b) * (p - c)) ** 0.5

This code uses the formula for the area of a triangle (A = (b * h) / 2) to calculate the area of the triangle. The formula is only valid for a valid triangle, which is determined by checking if the sum of any two sides is greater than the third side. If the triangle is valid, the area is returned rounded to 2 decimal points. If the triangle is not valid, 0 is returned.

Please note that this code assumes that the lengths of the sides are positive integers. If you need to handle negative or decimal numbers, you will need to modify the code accordingly.

Also, this code uses the `round` function to round the area to 2 decimal points, and the `**` operator to raise the value of `p` to the power of 0.5.</s>
