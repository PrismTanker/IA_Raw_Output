This test suite uses the Hypothesis library to generate random integers for the three sides of the triangle. It then uses the `assert` statement to check that the returned value is 0 if the three sides form an invalid triangle, and that the returned value is greater than 0 if the three sides form a valid triangle. The test suite uses the `given` statement to generate random integers for the three sides of the triangle. The `given` statement takes in three arguments: the first argument is the strategy for generating the first side of the triangle, the second argument is the strategy for generating the second side of the triangle, and the third argument is the strategy for generating the third side of the triangle. The `given` statement is used twice in the test suite, once for each property that is being tested.</s>  ```
import math

def get_triangle_area(a, b, c):
    perimeter = a + b + c
    if perimeter < 2 * math.sqrt(a * b * c):
        return 0
    s = (a + b + c) / 2
    area = math.sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c))
    return area
```
This code uses the formula for the area of a triangle to calculate the area if the three sides form a valid triangle. It first calculates the perimeter of the triangle and checks if it is greater than twice the product of the lengths of any two sides. If it is, then the triangle is valid and the area can be calculated. The formula for the area of a triangle is used to calculate the area, which is returned if the triangle is valid, or 0 if it is not.

Note that this code assumes that the three sides are given in the order a, b, and c, and that they are all non-negative. If the sides are given in a different order or if the sides are negative, then the code may need to be modified.</s>
