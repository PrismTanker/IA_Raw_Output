Prompt: Return list of prime factors of given integer in the order from smallest to largest.
    Each of the factors should be listed number of times corresponding to how many times it appeares in factorization.
    Input number should be equal to the product of all factors

  ```
from hypothesis import given, strategies

def property_test(candidate_function) -> None:

    @given(strategies.integers(min_value=1, max_value=1000000000))
    def property_1(n):
        factors = candidate_function(n)
        assert all(isinstance(factor, int) for factor in factors)
        assert all(factor > 1 for factor in factors)
        assert len(factors) == len(set(factors))
        assert all(factors[i] >= factors[i + 1] for i in range(len(factors) - 1))
        assert sum(factors) == n

    @given(strategies.integers(min_value=1, max_value=1000000000))
    def property_2(n):
        factors = candidate_function(n)
        assert all(factor in factors for factor in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1))
        assert all(factor not in factors for factor in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1))

    return [property_1, property_2]

This test suite includes two property tests:

1. `property_1`: This test ensures that the returned list of factors is a list of integers, is sorted in ascending order, has no duplicates, and has the correct number of occurrences of each factor.
2. `property_2`: This test ensures that the returned list of factors contains all prime factors of the input number and that it contains no composite factors.

The `given` decorator is used to generate random inputs for the two properties, and the `strategies` module is used to generate random integers within a specific range. The `property_1` test case generates inputs for `n` between 1 and 1000000000, and the `property_2` test case generates inputs for `n` between 1 and 1000000000.</s>  ```
def prime_factors(n):
    factors = []
    i = 2
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i:
            i += 1
        else:
            n //= i
            factors.append(i)
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)
    return factors
```
This code uses a while loop to iterate over all possible factors of the input number `n`. It checks if the number is divisible by the current factor `i`, and if it is, it divides `n` by the factor and adds the factor to the list of prime factors. If the number is not divisible by any of the factors, it increments the factor by 1 and checks again.

The list of prime factors is returned at the end of the function.

For example, if we call the function with the input number `12`, it will return the list `[2, 2, 3]`. This is because `12` can be expressed as `2 x 2 x 3`, and the function returns the factors in the order they appear in the factorization.</s>
