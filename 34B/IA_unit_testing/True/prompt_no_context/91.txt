Prompt: 
    You'll be given a string of words, and your task is to count the number
    of boredoms. A boredom is a sentence that starts with the word "I".
    Sentences are delimited by '.', '?' or '!'.
   
    For example:
    >>> is_bored("Hello world")
    0
    >>> is_bored("The sky is blue. The sun is shining. I love this weather")
    1

* `punctuation_boredom`: Tests that the function can handle punctuation in the input string.
* `uppercase_boredom`: Tests that the function can handle uppercase letters in the input string.
* `empty_string`: Tests that the function returns 0 when the input string is empty.</s>  Here's a test suite for the given problem:

    import re
    return len(re.findall(r'\bI\b', string))
[/PYTHON]
</s>  ```
def is_bored(sentence):
    return sentence.count("I")
```

This code uses the `count` method of the string class to count the number of occurrences of the letter "I" in the sentence. The `count` method returns an integer representing the number of occurrences of the letter "I" in the sentence.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```
sentence = "The sky is blue. The sun is shining. I love this weather"
print(is_bored(sentence)) # Output: 1
```
Note that this function assumes that the sentences are delimited by '.', '?' or '!'. If the sentences are delimited by a different character, you may need to modify the function accordingly.</s>
