Prompt: Return a greatest common divisor of two integers.
-------------------
  Here is a sample test suite to test a future solution for the problem of returning the greatest common divisor of two integers:
```
{
    "test_gcd_of_2_and_3": {
        "in": {
            "a": 2,
            "b": 3
        },
        "out": 1
    },
    "test_gcd_of_10_and_15": {
        "in": {
            "a": 10,
            "b": 15
        },
        "out": 5
    },
    "test_gcd_of_100_and_1000": {
        "in": {
            "a": 100,
            "b": 1000
        },
        "out": 1
    },
    "test_gcd_of_0_and_10": {
        "in": {
            "a": 0,
            "b": 10
        },
        "out": 10
    },
    "test_gcd_of_10_and_0": {
        "in": {
            "a": 10,
            "b": 0
        },
        "out": 10
    },
    "test_gcd_of_0_and_0": {
        "in": {
            "a": 0,
            "b": 0
        },
        "out": 0
    },
    "test_gcd_of_negative_numbers": {
        "in": {
            "a": -10,
            "b": -15
        },
        "out": 5
    }
}
```
In this test suite, each test case represents a pair of inputs and an expected output. The inputs are given as a dictionary with the parameters `a` and `b`, and the expected output is given as a scalar value. The test cases cover a range of scenarios, including positive and negative numbers, zeroes, and edge cases.</s>  ```
def gcd(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a
```</s>  ```
def gcd(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        return a
    else:
        return gcd(b, a % b)
```</s>  ```
def gcd(a, b):
    while b != 0:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a
```
This function uses the Euclidean algorithm to calculate the greatest common divisor of two integers. It does this by repeatedly taking the remainder of the smaller number divided by the larger number, and then swapping the two numbers. The loop will terminate when the smaller number is 0, and the larger number will be the greatest common divisor.

The function returns the greatest common divisor of the two input numbers.

For example, if you call the function with the following arguments:
```
gcd(12, 15)
```
The function will return 3, since 3 is the greatest common divisor of 12 and 15.</s>  ```
def gcd(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a
```</s>  ```
def gcd(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a
```</s>  ```
def gcd(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a
```</s>  ```
def gcd(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        return a
    else:
        return gcd(b, a % b)
```
This code defines a function `gcd` that takes two integers `a` and `b` as input and returns their greatest common divisor. The function uses recursion to find the gcd by repeatedly calling itself with the smaller of the two input values and the remainder of the larger value divided by the smaller value. The function terminates when the smaller value is 0, at which point the gcd is the larger value.

For example, if you call the function with `gcd(12, 15)`, it will return `3`, because 3 is the greatest common divisor of 12 and 15.</s>  ```
def gcd(a, b):
    if a == 0:
        return b
    return gcd(b % a, a)
```</s>  ```
def gcd(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        return a
    else:
        return gcd(b, a % b)
```
This function uses the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor of two integers. The function recursively calls itself with the smaller of the two integers and the remainder of the two integers divided by the smaller integer. The base case is when the smaller integer is 0, in which case the gcd is the larger integer.</s>  ```
def gcd(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a
```
This code uses the Euclidean algorithm to calculate the greatest common divisor of two integers. It iteratively computes the remainder of the division of the two integers by the current greatest common divisor, until the remainder is 0, which means that the current greatest common divisor is the greatest common divisor of the two integers.

For example, if we want to calculate the GCD of 12 and 18, we can use the following steps:

1. 12 / 18 = 0 remainder 6
2. 18 / 6 = 3 remainder 0

Therefore, the GCD of 12 and 18 is 6.

You can test this code with the following test cases:

* gcd(12, 18) should return 6
* gcd(10, 15) should return 5
* gcd(100, 101) should return 1
* gcd(101, 100) should return 1

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.</s>
