This function works by counting the number of pairs of cars that can collide. Since there are `n` cars moving left to right and `n` cars moving right to left, there are `n * n` possible pairs of cars. However, we need to divide by 2 because each collision is counted twice (once for each car). Therefore, the total number of collisions is `n * (n - 1) // 2`.</s>  ```

Explanation:

The number of collisions is equal to the number of pairs of cars that can collide. Since there are n cars moving left to right and n cars moving right to left, there are n \* (n - 1) / 2 pairs of cars that can collide.

This solution assumes that the cars are infinitely far apart and that the road is infinitely long, so the cars will never collide with each other. In a real-world scenario, the cars would eventually collide with each other due to their finite size and the finite length of the road.</s>  ```

Explanation:

Explanation:

The number of collisions is equal to the number of pairs of cars that can collide. Since there are n cars moving left to right and n cars moving right to left, there are n \* (n - 1) pairs of cars that can collide. However, since each collision involves two cars, we need to divide the result by 2 to get the total number of collisions. Therefore, the formula is n \* (n - 1) // 2.</s>  ```
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    return (n * (n + 1)) // 2
```
Explanation:

The formula for the number of collisions is (n \* (n + 1)) / 2. This is because each car has a chance to collide with each of the other cars, and the probability of collision is the same for each car. Therefore, the total number of collisions is the sum of the probabilities of collision for each car, which is (n \* (n + 1)) / 2.

Here's an example to illustrate the formula:

Suppose there are 4 cars moving in opposite directions. The possible collisions are:

* Car 1 collides with Car 4
* Car 2 collides with Car 3
* Car 3 collides with Car 2
* Car 4 collides with Car 1

The total number of collisions is 4, which is (4 \* (4 + 1)) / 2 = 10.

Note that this formula works for any positive integer value of n, not just 4.</s>

def car_race_collision(n: int):
    return n * (n - 1) // 2

Explanation:

The number of collisions is equal to the number of pairs of cars that can collide. Since there are `n` cars moving left to right and `n` cars moving right to left, there are a total of `n * n` possible pairs of cars. However, we need to exclude the pairs where the two cars are the same car, which is `n` pairs. Therefore, the total number of collisions is `n * (n - 1) // 2`.</s>  ```

Explanation:

The number of collisions can be calculated by finding the number of pairs of cars that can collide. Since there are n cars moving left to right and n cars moving right to left, the total number of pairs of cars that can collide is n \* (n - 1). However, we need to divide the result by 2 because each collision is counted twice (once for each car). Therefore, the final result is n \* (n - 1) // 2.</s>  ```

def car_race_collision(n: int):
    return n * (n - 1) // 2
```
This function works by considering the pairs of cars that could potentially collide. There are n pairs of cars, and each pair consists of one car moving left to right and one car moving right to left. The function uses the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series to calculate the total number of collisions.

For example, if n = 5, there are 5 pairs of cars that could potentially collide: (1, 5), (2, 4), (3, 3), (4, 2), and (5, 1). The function returns 5 * (5 - 1) // 2 = 10, which is the total number of collisions.

Note that this function assumes that the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong, so they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide. If the cars are not infinitely sturdy, then the function would need to be modified to account for the possibility of cars stopping or changing direction after a collision.</s>  ```
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    return n * (n - 1) // 2
```
Explanation:

The problem states that there are n cars moving left to right and n cars moving right to left. Let's consider a car moving left to right as car 1 and a car moving right to left as car 2. For a collision to occur, car 1 must be moving left to right and car 2 must be moving right to left, and they must be at the same point on the road at the same time.

Since all cars move at the same speed, the distance between any two cars is constant. Therefore, the number of collisions is equal to the number of pairs of cars that can collide.

There are n cars moving left to right, and each car can collide with any of the n cars moving right to left. Therefore, the number of collisions is n \* (n - 1). However, this counts each collision twice (once for each car), so we need to divide by 2 to get the correct answer.

Therefore, the number of collisions is n \* (n - 1) // 2.</s>  ```
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    return n * (n - 1) // 2
```
Explanation:

The number of collisions is equal to the number of pairs of cars that can collide. Since there are `n` cars moving left to right and `n` cars moving right to left, the total number of pairs is `n * n`. However, we need to divide by 2 because each collision is counted twice (once for each car). Therefore, the number of collisions is `n * (n - 1) // 2`.</s>  ```
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    return n * (n - 1) // 2
```
Explanation:

The number of collisions is equal to the number of pairs of cars that can collide. Since there are n cars moving left to right and n cars moving right to left, there are n \* n possible pairs of cars. However, we need to account for the fact that each pair is counted twice (once for each car in the pair). Therefore, we need to divide the total number of pairs by 2 to get the actual number of collisions.

This can be expressed mathematically as:

n \* (n - 1) / 2

This is a standard formula for finding the number of pairs in a set of n items.</s>  ```
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    return n * (n - 1) // 2
```
Explanation:

The number of collisions can be calculated using the formula (n \* (n - 1)) // 2.

The formula works by considering the following:

1. Each car on the left side can collide with each car on the right side.
2. Each collision occurs in only one direction (i.e., a car on the left side can only collide with a car on the right side, not the other way around).
3. The number of collisions is equal to the number of pairs of cars that can collide.

The number of pairs of cars that can collide is equal to the number of cars on the left side multiplied by the number of cars on the right side, minus the number of pairs of cars that are not in the same lane (i.e., the number of cars on the left side multiplied by the number of cars on the right side minus the number of cars on the left side multiplied by the number of cars on the right side).

This is the formula (n \* (n - 1)) // 2, which gives the number of collisions.</s>  ```

def car_race_collision(n: int):

This function uses the formula for the number of ways to choose two elements from a set of size `n` to calculate the number of collisions. Each pair of cars has a probability of `1/2` of colliding, so the expected number of collisions is `n * (n - 1) / 2`.

Here's a brief explanation of the formula:

* The number of ways to choose two elements from a set of size `n` is `n * (n - 1) / 2`.
* This is because there are `n` choices for the first element, and `n - 1` choices for the second element (since the first element cannot be chosen again).
* Therefore, the probability of choosing a particular pair of elements is `1/2`, since there are `n * (n - 1) / 2` possible pairs.

This function is `O(1)` since it has a constant number of operations, regardless of the size of `n`.</s>  ```

Note that the output values for each test case are calculated using the formula: `n * (n - 1) / 2`. This formula calculates the number of pairs of cars that can collide, which is equal to the number of collisions.</s>  ```
def car_race_collision(n):
    return n * (n - 1) // 2
```
Explanation:

The number of collisions is equal to the number of pairs of cars that can collide. Since there are `n` cars moving left to right and `n` cars moving right to left, the number of pairs is `n * (n - 1)`. However, we need to divide by 2 because each collision is counted twice (once for each car). Therefore, the final answer is `n * (n - 1) // 2`.</s>  ```
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    return n * (n - 1) // 2
```
Explanation:

The problem is asking for the number of pairs of cars that collide. Since the cars are moving in opposite directions, each car can only collide with one other car. Therefore, the number of collisions is equal to the number of pairs of cars.

The number of pairs of cars is equal to the number of ways to choose 2 cars from a set of n cars, which is equal to n * (n - 1) / 2.</s>  ```
def car_race_collision(n):
    # Initialize a set to store the positions of cars moving left to right
    left_to_right = set()
    # Initialize a set to store the positions of cars moving right to left
    right_to_left = set()
    # Initialize a variable to store the number of collisions
    collisions = 0

    # Iterate over the positions of the cars moving left to right
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        # If the position is also in the set of cars moving right to left,
        # then there is a collision
        if i in right_to_left:
            collisions += 1
        # Add the position to the set of cars moving left to right
        left_to_right.add(i)

    # Iterate over the positions of the cars moving right to left
    for i in range(n, 0, -1):
        # If the position is also in the set of cars moving left to right,
        # then there is a collision
        if i in left_to_right:
            collisions += 1
        # Add the position to the set of cars moving right to left
        right_to_left.add(i)

    return collisions
```</s>  ```
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    return n * (n - 1) // 2
```
Explanation:

The number of collisions is equal to the number of pairs of cars that can collide. Since there are n cars moving left to right and n cars moving right to left, there are a total of n \* n = n^2 pairs of cars that can potentially collide. However, we need to account for the fact that each pair of cars can only collide once. Therefore, we need to divide the total number of pairs by 2, since each collision is counted twice (once for each car). The resulting expression is n * (n - 1) / 2, which is the same as n * (n - 1) // 2 in Python.</s>  ```
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    return n * (n - 1) // 2
```
Explanation:

The number of collisions is equal to the number of pairs of cars that can collide. Since there are `n` cars moving left to right and `n` cars moving right to left, the number of pairs is `n * (n - 1) / 2`. This is because each car can collide with each of the other `n - 1` cars.

For example, if `n = 4`, the number of collisions is `4 * (4 - 1) / 2 = 6`.</s>  ```
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    return n * (n - 1) // 2
```
Explanation:

The number of collisions can be calculated using the formula: (n * (n - 1)) / 2.

Here's how the formula works:

* The first car has n - 1 cars to collide with, so it contributes n - 1 collisions.
* The second car has n - 2 cars to collide with, so it contributes n - 2 collisions.
* The third car has n - 3 cars to collide with, so it contributes n - 3 collisions.
* And so on, until the last car, which has 1 car to collide with, so it contributes 1 collision.

Therefore, the total number of collisions is (n - 1) + (n - 2) + (n - 3) + ... + 1 = n * (n - 1) / 2.</s>  ```
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    return n * (n - 1) // 2
```
Explanation:

The number of collisions is equal to the number of pairs of cars that can collide. There are `n` cars moving left to right, and `n` cars moving right to left. Each car can collide with `n - 1` other cars, since it cannot collide with itself. Therefore, the total number of collisions is `n * (n - 1)`. However, each collision is counted twice (once for each car involved), so we need to divide by 2 to get the correct number of collisions. Therefore, the final answer is `n * (n - 1) // 2`.</s>  ```
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    # Initialize the number of collisions to 0
    collisions = 0

    # Iterate over the cars moving left to right
    for i in range(n):
        # Check if the car moving left to right has passed the car moving right to left
        if i >= n - collisions:
            # Increment the number of collisions
            collisions += 1

    # Return the number of collisions
    return collisions
```</s>  ```
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    return n * (n - 1) // 2
```
Explanation:

The number of collisions is equal to the number of pairs of cars that can collide. Since there are `n` cars moving left to right and `n` cars moving right to left, the total number of pairs is `n * n`. However, we need to subtract the number of pairs where the two cars are the same, which is `n`. Therefore, the total number of collisions is `n * (n - 1)`.</s>  ```
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    return n * (n - 1) // 2
```
Explanation:

The number of collisions is equal to the number of pairs of cars that can collide. There are `n` cars moving left to right and `n` cars moving right to left, so the total number of pairs of cars is `n * n`. However, we need to divide by 2 because we don't want to count each collision twice (once for each car). Therefore, the number of collisions is `n * (n - 1) // 2`.</s>
