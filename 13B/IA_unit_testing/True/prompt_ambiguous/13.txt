def gcd(a, b):

```
This function takes two integers as input and returns their greatest common divisor. The algorithm works by repeatedly subtracting the smaller number from the larger number until the smaller number is 0, at which point the larger number is the GCD.

Here is an example usage of the function:
```
print(gcd(10, 15)) # prints 5
print(gcd(30, 45)) # prints 15
```
This function is efficient, as it only requires a single loop iteration to find the GCD of two numbers. The time complexity of the function is O(1), as the number of iterations is a constant.

Note: This function assumes that the input numbers are positive. If the input numbers can be negative, you may need to add additional logic to handle this case.</s>  ```
def gcd(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        return a
    else:
        return gcd(b, a % b)
```
This function uses the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor of two integers. It works by repeatedly subtracting the smaller number from the larger number until the smaller number is 0, and then returning the larger number.

Here is an example of how to use this function:
```
print(gcd(10, 15))  # Output: 5
print(gcd(100, 150))  # Output: 50
print(gcd(1000, 1500))  # Output: 500
```
This function passes the following test cases:
```
def test_gcd():
    assert gcd(10, 15) == 5
    assert gcd(100, 150) == 50
    assert gcd(1000, 1500) == 500
```</s>  ```
def gcd(a, b):
    while b != 0:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a
```
This function uses the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor of two integers. It takes two integers as input and returns the greatest common divisor.

Here is an example of how the function can be used:
```
print(gcd(10, 15))  # Output: 5
print(gcd(15, 25))  # Output: 5
```
This code will output the greatest common divisors of 10 and 15, which is 5, and 15 and 25, which is also 5.

This function is efficient because it uses the Euclidean algorithm, which is an efficient method for finding the greatest common divisor of two integers. The algorithm has a time complexity of O(log(min(a, b))), which means that the time it takes to find the greatest common divisor increases logarithmically with the smaller of the two integers. This means that the function will be fast for both small and large integers.

It is also worth noting that this function is written in a modular way, meaning that it can be easily reused in other programs. This is a good practice in programming, as it makes it easier to write and maintain code.</s>  ```
def gcd(a, b):
    while b != 0:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a
```
This function uses the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor of two integers. It takes two integers `a` and `b` as input and returns the greatest common divisor of `a` and `b`.

The function works by repeatedly dividing the larger number by the smaller number until the smaller number is 0. The remainder of the division is the greatest common divisor.

For example, if we call the function with `a = 10` and `b = 15`, the function will perform the following operations:
```
10 / 15 = 0 with a remainder of 5
15 / 5 = 3 with a remainder of 0
```
Since the remainder is 0, the greatest common divisor is 5.

This function can be used to find the greatest common divisor of two integers in a single line of code:
```
gcd(10, 15)
```
This will return the value 5.</s>  ```
def gcd(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        return a
    else:
        return gcd(b, a % b)
```
This code uses the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers. It works by repeatedly dividing the smaller number by the larger number until the result is 0, at which point the smaller number is the GCD.

Here is an example of how this code can be used:
```
>>> gcd(10, 15)
5
```
This code returns the GCD of 10 and 15, which is 5.

This code passes the following test cases:
```
>>> gcd(10, 15)
5
>>> gcd(24, 36)
12
>>> gcd(100, 120)
20
>>> gcd(1000, 1200)
200
```
Note that this code assumes that the input numbers are positive integers. If the input numbers can be negative, you may need to modify the code to handle that case.</s>  ```
def gcd(a, b):
    while b != 0:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a
```
This function uses the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor of two integers. The algorithm starts by taking the larger of the two numbers and repeatedly subtracting the smaller number until the smaller number is 0. The remaining number is the greatest common divisor.

```
This function takes two integers as input and returns their greatest common divisor. The function uses the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor. The algorithm starts by taking the second number as the remainder of the first number, and then repeatedly subtracts the smaller number from the larger number until the smaller number is 0. The last non-zero number is the greatest common divisor.

This function uses the built-in `%` operator to calculate the remainder of the division of the two numbers.

For example, if we call the function with `gcd(12, 15)`, the function will first calculate `15 % 12 = 3`, then `3 % 12 = 0`, so the function will return `3`.

The function also works for negative numbers. For example, `gcd(-12, -15)` will return `-3`.

Note that this function only works for integers, if you need to find the greatest common divisor of two non-integer numbers, you will need to use a different algorithm.</s>  ```
def gcd(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        return a
    else:
        return gcd(b, a % b)
```
This function uses the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor of two integers. It works by repeatedly dividing the larger number by the smaller number until the result is 0, at which point the remainder is the greatest common divisor.

Here are some test cases to demonstrate the function's behavior:
```
assert gcd(10, 15) == 5
assert gcd(15, 10) == 5
assert gcd(100, 15) == 5
assert gcd(15, 100) == 5
```
These test cases verify that the function correctly computes the greatest common divisor of two integers.</s>  ```
def gcd(a, b):
    while b != 0:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a
```
This code uses the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor of two integers `a` and `b`. The algorithm starts by setting `b` to the remainder of `a` divided by `b`, and then repeats this process until `b` is equal to 0. The final value of `a` is the greatest common divisor of `a` and `b`.

This function can be tested with the following code:
```
print(gcd(12, 15))  # should print 3
print(gcd(24, 30))  # should print 6
print(gcd(100, 101))  # should print 1
```
Note that the `print` statement is used to display the result of the function call. The `#` symbol is used to indicate a comment, which is not executed by the Python interpreter.</s>  ```
