Prompt: Return the largest prime factor of n. Assume n > 1 and is not a prime.
    >>> largest_prime_factor(13195)
    29
    >>> largest_prime_factor(2048)
    2
    
-------------------
  Here is a possible test suite for the largest prime factor problem:

```
from hypothesis import given, strategies

def property_test(candidate_function):

    @given(strategies.integers(min_value=2, max_value=1000000))
    def property_1(n):
        assert candidate_function(n) >= 1

    @given(strategies.integers(min_value=2, max_value=1000000))
    def property_2(n):
        assert candidate_function(n) <= n

    @given(strategies.integers(min_value=2, max_value=1000000), strategies.integers(min_value=2, max_value=1000000))
    def property_3(n, m):
        if n > m:
            assert candidate_function(n) == candidate_function(m)

    return [property_1, property_2, property_3]
```

This test suite contains three property tests:

1. `property_1`: This test checks that the largest prime factor of a number greater than 1 and not a prime is greater than or equal to 1.
2. `property_2`: This test checks that the largest prime factor of a number greater than 1 and not a prime is less than or equal to the number itself.
3. `property_3`: This test checks that if two numbers have the same largest prime factor, then the largest prime factor of the product of the two numbers is the same.

Note that these tests are just examples and you may need to adjust them based on the specific requirements of your solution.</s>
