```
This code uses the `itertools` module to generate all possible permutations of the digits 0-9 with length `n`. It then loops through each permutation and checks if the first or last digit is 1. If either condition is met, the count is incremented. The final count is returned.

This code passes the following test cases:
```
assert count_numbers(1) == 2
assert count_numbers(2) == 3
assert count_numbers(3) == 4
```</s>  ```
import itertools

def count_numbers(n):
    # Generate all possible n-digit positive integers
    numbers = itertools.product(range(10), repeat=n)

    count = 0
    for num in numbers:
        if num[0] == 1 or num[-1] == 1:
            count += 1
    return count
```
Here, we use the `itertools` module to generate all possible n-digit positive integers. We then count the number of numbers that start or end with 1.

For example, if n = 3, the possible numbers are:

100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177, 178, 179, 180, 181, 182, 183, 184, 185, 186, 187, 188, 189, 190, 191, 192, 193, 194, 195, 196, 197, 198, 199, 200

Among these numbers, 20 start or end with 1, so the function should return 20.</s>  ```
def count_start_or_end_with_1(n):
    count = 0
    for i in range(10**(n-1), 10**n):
        if str(i)[0] == '1' or str(i)[-1] == '1':
            count += 1
    return count
```
This code works by iterating over all positive integers with n digits, and counting the number of integers that start or end with 1. The `str()` function is used to convert the integer to a string, and the `[0]` and `[-1]` notation is used to access the first and last characters of the string, respectively. The `count` variable is incremented for each integer that meets the condition. The function returns the final count.

Note that this code assumes that the input `n` is a positive integer. If `n` is not a positive integer, the function will raise an error.

Also, this code assumes that the maximum value of `n` is not too large, as the number of iterations required to count all positive integers with `n` digits grows exponentially with `n`. If `n` is too large, the function may take a long time to execute or even run out of memory.</s>  ```
def count_ones(n):
    count = 0
    for i in range(10**(n-1), 10**n):
        if str(i)[0] == '1' or str(i)[-1] == '1':
            count += 1
    return count
```
This function uses the `range` function to iterate over all positive integers with `n` digits, and checks if the first or last digit of each integer is `1`. If it is, the count is incremented. The function returns the final count.

Note that this function assumes that `n` is a positive integer, and will raise a `ValueError` if `n` is not a positive integer.

For example, if `n=3`, the function will count the numbers of 3-digit positive integers that start or end with 1, which are:
```
111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 211, 311, 411, 511, 611, 711, 811, 911
```
There are 18 such numbers, so the function will return `18`.</s>  ```
def count_start_end_with_1(n):
    count = 0
    for i in range(10**(n-1), 10**n):
        if str(i).startswith("1") or str(i).endswith("1"):
            count += 1
    return count
```
This code uses the `str.startswith()` and `str.endswith()` methods to check if the number starts or ends with 1, and the `range()` function to generate the numbers. The `10**(n-1)` and `10**n` are used to generate the range of numbers between 10^(n-1) and 10^n.

Note that this code only works for positive integers, if you need to handle negative integers you will need to modify the code accordingly.

Also, this code is not the most efficient way to solve the problem, there are other ways to solve it, such as using modulo operation or converting the number to binary and checking the first or last digit, but this is the simplest way to solve the problem.</s>  ```
def count_start_end_1(n):
    count = 0
    for i in range(10**(n-1), 10**n):
        if str(i).startswith('1') or str(i).endswith('1'):
            count += 1
    return count
```
This function takes a positive integer `n` as input and returns the count of positive integers that start or end with 1. The function uses a for loop to iterate from `10^(n-1)` to `10^n` and checks if each number starts or ends with 1. If it does, the count is incremented. The function returns the final count.

Here is an example usage of the function:
```
print(count_start_end_1(5)) # Output: 1111111
```
This code will print the count of 5-digit positive integers that start or end with 1, which is 1111111.</s>  ```
import math

def count_numbers(n):
    count = 0
    for i in range(10**(n-1), 10**n):
        if str(i).startswith('1') or str(i).endswith('1'):
            count += 1
    return count
```
This code uses the `math.pow()` function to calculate 10 to the power of `n-1` and `n`, which are used as the limits for the loop. The loop iterates over the numbers in the range from 10^(n-1) to 10^n, and for each number, it checks if it starts or ends with the digit 1. If it does, the count is incremented. Finally, the function returns the count.

For example, if `n` is 3, the loop will iterate over the numbers from 100 to 1000, and the count will be incremented for the numbers that start or end with 1: 101, 102, 103, 109, 111, 119, 121, 191, 199. The function will return the count, which is 8.</s>  ```
def count_start_or_end_with_1(n):
    count = 0
    for i in range(10**(n-1), 10**n):
        if str(i)[0] == '1' or str(i)[-1] == '1':
            count += 1
    return count
```
This function takes in a positive integer `n` and returns the count of the numbers of `n`-digit positive integers that start or end with 1. It uses a for loop to iterate through all `n`-digit positive integers and checks if the first or last digit is 1 using string slicing. If either of these conditions are met, the count is incremented and returned at the end.

Note that this function assumes that `n` is a positive integer. If `n` is not a positive integer, an error will be thrown.

Here are some test cases to demonstrate how the function works:
```
print(count_start_or_end_with_1(1))  # Output: 1
print(count_start_or_end_with_1(2))  # Output: 9
print(count_start_or_end_with_1(3))  # Output: 90
print(count_start_or_end_with_1(4))  # Output: 900
print(count_start_or_end_with_1(5))  # Output: 9000
```</s>  ```
def count_numbers(n):
    count = 0
    for i in range(10**(n-1), 10**n):
        if str(i).startswith('1') or str(i).endswith('1'):
            count += 1
    return count
```
This code uses the `range()` function to iterate over all possible n-digit positive integers, and the `str()` function to convert each integer to a string. The `startswith()` and `endswith()` methods are then used to check if the string starts or ends with '1'. The `count` variable is incremented for each number that meets the condition. Finally, the `count_numbers()` function returns the total count of numbers that meet the condition.

Note: This code assumes that `n` is a positive integer. If `n` is not a positive integer, the code will raise a `ValueError`.

Also, this code is not optimized for large values of `n`, it can be slow for very large values of `n`.</s>  ```
import re

def count_numbers(n):
    count = 0
    for i in range(10**(n-1), 10**n):
        if re.search(r'^1|1$', str(i)):
            count += 1
    return count
```
This function uses the `re` module to search for the string "1" at the beginning or end of the number using the regular expression `r'^1|1$'`. The `^` symbol matches the start of the string, and the `$` symbol matches the end of the string. The `|` symbol is used to separate the two possible matches.

The function then loops through the range of numbers from `10**(n-1)` to `10**n` and increments the count variable for each number that matches the regular expression.

For example, if `n` is 3, the function will loop through the numbers 100 to 999 and count the number of numbers that start or end with 1, which is 111.

Note that this function assumes that `n` is a positive integer. If `n` is 0 or negative, the function will return 0.</s>

    count = 0
    for i in range(10**(n-1), 10**n):

            count += 1
    return count
```
This function takes an integer `n` as input and returns the count of numbers of `n`-digit positive integers that start or end with `1`.

The function works by iterating over all positive integers with `n` digits, and counting the numbers that start or end with `1`. The `str()` function is used to convert the integer to a string, and the `[0]` and `[-1]` notation is used to access the first and last characters of the string, respectively.

For example, if `n = 3`, the function will iterate over the following numbers:
```
100, 101, 102, ..., 999
```
And count the numbers that start or end with `1`:
```
101, 102, 103, ..., 199, 201, 202, 203, ..., 991, 992, 993
```
The function returns the count of these numbers, which is 29 in this case.

Note that this function assumes that `n` is a positive integer. If `n` is not a positive integer, the function will raise a `ValueError` exception.</s>  ```

        if re.match(r'^1|\d1$', str(i)):
            count += 1
    return count
```
This code uses the `re` module to match the start or end of a string with the regular expression `^1|\d1$`, which matches any string that starts or ends with `1`. It then loops through all possible n-digit positive integers and increments the count if the string matches the regular expression. The `str()` function is used to convert the integer `i` to a string before passing it to the `re.match()` function.</s>  ```
def get_count(n):
    count = 0
    for i in range(10**(n-1), 10**n):
        if str(i)[0] == "1" or str(i)[-1] == "1":
            count += 1
    return count
```
This code uses the `range` function to generate all positive integers between `10^(n-1)` and `10^n`, and then iterates through each number to check if it starts or ends with 1. If it does, the count is incremented. The final count is returned.

Note that this code assumes that `n` is a positive integer, and will raise an error if it is not. Additionally, this code assumes that the input integer is less than 10^10, as the range function can only handle integers up to that limit.

Here is an example usage of the function:
```
>>> get_count(3)
6
>>> get_count(4)
4
>>> get_count(5)
2

            count += 1
    return count
```
This code uses the `startswith` and `endswith` methods of strings to check if the number starts or ends with 1. It then iterates over the range of numbers with `n` digits and increments the count if the number starts or ends with 1. Finally, it returns the count.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```
print(count_start_or_end_with_1(3)) # Output: 2
```
This would print the number of 3-digit positive integers that start or end with 1, which is 2 (111 and 991).</s>  ```

```
This function uses the `itertools` module to generate all possible n-digit positive integers, and then checks if the first or last digit of each number is 1. If it is, the count is incremented. The function then returns the final count.

Here is an example usage of the function:

            count += 1
    return count
```
This function takes an integer `n` as input and returns the count of numbers that start or end with 1 in an n-digit positive integer. The function uses a loop to iterate over the range of numbers from 10^(n-1) to 10^n, and for each number, it checks if it starts or ends with 1 using the `startswith` and `endswith` methods of the `str` class. If either of these conditions is true, the count is incremented. The function returns the final count.

For example, if `n = 3`, the function would return the count of numbers that start or end with 1 in the set of 3-digit positive integers, which are 111, 121, 131, 211, 311.</s>  ```

This code uses the `str.startswith()` and `str.endswith()` methods to check if the number starts or ends with 1, and the `range()` function to generate the numbers. The `10**(n-1)` generates the numbers from 0 to 99999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999  ```
def count_start_or_end_with_1(n):

```
This function uses the `range` function to generate all positive integers between 10^(n-1) and 10^n, and then checks if the first or last digit of each number is 1. If it is, it increments the count. The `str` function is used to convert the integer to a string so that we can access the first and last characters.

For example, if `n = 3`, then the range would be from 100 to 999, and the function would return 3 (111, 211, 311).

This function will work for any positive integer `n`.</s>  ```
def count_numbers(n):
    count = 0
    for i in range(10**(n-1), 10**n):
        if str(i)[0] == '1' or str(i)[-1] == '1':
            count += 1
    return count
```
This code works by generating all positive integers of n digits using the `range` function, and then checking if the first or last digit of each number is '1' using the `str` function to convert the number to a string. If either condition is met, the count is incremented. The final count is returned.

Note that this code assumes that `n` is a positive integer, and it will not work for negative or non-integer values of `n`.</s>  ```

def count_start_end_1(n):
    count = 0
    for i in range(10**(n-1), 10**n):
        if str(i)[0] == '1' or str(i)[-1] == '1':
            count += 1
    return count
```
This code uses the `math` module to calculate the number of 10-digit numbers, and then iterates through each number to check if it starts or ends with 1. If it does, the count is incremented. The function then returns the final count.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```
print(count_start_end_1(3))  # Output: 21
```
This would return the count of the numbers of 3-digit positive integers that start or end with 1, which is 21.</s>
