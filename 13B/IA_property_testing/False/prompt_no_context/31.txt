This code uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to determine if a number is prime. It works by iterating through the numbers from 2 to the square root of the input number, and checking if the number is divisible by any of those numbers. If it is not divisible by any of those numbers, it must be prime. The `math.sqrt()` function is used to calculate the square root of the input number, and the `int()` function is used to convert the result to an integer.</s>  ```

This code uses the `math` module to calculate the square root of the input number, and then checks if the number is divisible by any number between 2 and the square root. If it is not divisible by any number, it is prime.

Note that this function is not optimized for performance, but it should work for most cases. If you need a faster implementation, you can use a more advanced algorithm such as the Sieve of Eratosthenes.</s>  ```

This code uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to determine if a given number is prime. The algorithm works by iterating through the numbers from 2 to the square root of the input number, and checking if the current number is a factor of the input number. If a factor is found, the number is not prime, and the function returns False. If no factors are found, the number is prime, and the function returns True.

The code also includes a check to ensure that the input number is greater than 1, as 1 is not prime.

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n^0.5), which is the best possible time complexity for a primality test.

Note that this code is not optimized for very large numbers, as the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm is not the most efficient algorithm for testing very large prime numbers. For larger numbers, other algorithms such as the Miller-Rabin primality test or the AKS primality test may be more appropriate.</s>  ```

This code uses the math module to calculate the square root of the input number, and then checks if the number is divisible by any number between 2 and the square root. If it is not divisible by any of these numbers, it is prime. The code also includes a special case for numbers less than or equal to 1, which are not prime.</s>  ```

This code uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to determine if a given number is prime. The algorithm works by iterating from 2 to the square root of the input number, and checking if the number is divisible by any of the numbers in the range. If the number is not divisible by any of the numbers in the range, it is prime.

The `math.sqrt()` function is used to compute the square root of the input number, and the `int()` function is used to convert the result to an integer.

The function returns `True` if the input number is prime, and `False` otherwise.

For example, calling `is_prime(6)` returns `False` because 6 is not prime. Calling `is_prime(101)` returns `True` because 101 is prime.

This function is efficient because it only checks the numbers up to the square root of the input number, which is the largest factor that can divide the input number.

Note that this function assumes the input number is a positive integer. If the input number is not a positive integer, the function will return `False`.</s>
