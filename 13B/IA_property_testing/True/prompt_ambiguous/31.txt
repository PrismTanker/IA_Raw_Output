This test suite uses the `hypothesis` library to generate random integers as inputs for the `candidate_function` and then checks if the function returns the correct result for each input. The `property_1` test checks if the function returns `False` when the input is less than or equal to 1, and the `property_2` test checks if the function returns `True` when the input is not divisible by any number between 2 and n-1 (inclusive).</s>  ```
def is_prime(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):

            return False
    return True
```
This function uses a simple trial division method to determine whether a number is prime. It first checks if the number is less than or equal to 1, which is not prime. Then, it iterates from 2 to the square root of the number, and checks if the number is divisible by any of these numbers. If the number is not divisible by any of these numbers, it is prime.

This function is efficient for small numbers, but for larger numbers, it can be improved using more advanced methods such as the Sieve of Eratosthenes.

Here is an example of how to use this function:
```
print(is_prime(13))  # Output: True
print(is_prime(14))  # Output: False
```</s>  ```
def is_prime(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```
This code defines a function `is_prime` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns `True` if `n` is prime, and `False` otherwise. The function starts by checking if `n` is less than or equal to 1, in which case it is not prime. If `n` is greater than 1, the function iterates over all integers `i` from 2 to `n ** 0.5` (the square root of `n`) and checks if `n` is divisible by any of them. If `n` is not divisible by any of these integers, it is prime and the function returns `True`. If `n` is divisible by any of these integers, it is not prime and the function returns `False`.

This function uses the fact that a number `n` is prime if and only if it is not divisible by any integer between 2 and `n ** 0.5` (inclusive). This is known as the Sieve of Eratosthenes, which is a simple and efficient method for determining whether a number is prime.</s>  ```
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```
This function checks if a number is prime by iterating through all the numbers between 2 and the square root of the given number, and returning False if any of them divide the given number evenly. If none of them do, the function returns True.

Note: This function only works for positive integers. If you need to test if a negative number is prime, you can modify the function to check if the absolute value of the number is prime.</s>
