Prompt: Check if there is equal open and close brackets.
-------------------
  Here is a test suite for a hypothetical solution to the problem of checking if there are equal open and close brackets:
```
{
    "check_equal_brackets": {
        "in": {
            "string": "()[]{}"
        },
        "out": true
    },
    "check_unequal_brackets": {
        "in": {
            "string": "()[]"
        },
        "out": false
    },
    "check_empty_string": {
        "in": {
            "string": ""
        },
        "out": true
    },
    "check_single_bracket": {
        "in": {
            "string": "("
        },
        "out": false
    },
    "check_nested_brackets": {
        "in": {
            "string": "(()[])"
        },
        "out": true
    },
    "check_unmatched_brackets": {
        "in": {
            "string": "()]"
        },
        "out": false
    }
}
```
This test suite includes several test cases to cover different scenarios, including:

* Checking for equal open and close brackets
* Checking for unequal open and close brackets
* Checking for an empty string
* Checking for a single bracket
* Checking for nested brackets
* Checking for unmatched brackets

Each test case includes an input string and the expected output (true or false) for the hypothetical solution to the problem.</s>  ```
def check_brackets(string):
    open_brackets = ["[", "{", "("]
    close_brackets = ["]", "}", ")"]
    stack = []
    for char in string:
        if char in open_brackets:
            stack.append(char)
        elif char in close_brackets:
            if not stack or open_brackets.index(stack.pop()) != close_brackets.index(char):
                return False
    return not stack
```</s>  ```
def is_balanced(s):
    open_brackets = ["(", "{", "["]
    close_brackets = [")", "}", "]"]
    stack = []
    for char in s:
        if char in open_brackets:
            stack.append(char)
        elif char in close_brackets:
            if not stack or open_brackets.index(stack.pop()) != close_brackets.index(char):
                return False
    return not stack
```

This function takes a string as input and returns True if the string has equal number of open and close brackets, and False otherwise. The function uses a stack to keep track of the open brackets and checks if the corresponding close bracket is present in the correct order.</s>  ```
def is_balanced_brackets(string):
    open_brackets = ["[", "{", "("]
    close_brackets = ["]", "}", ")"]
    stack = []
    for char in string:
        if char in open_brackets:
            stack.append(char)
        elif char in close_brackets:
            if not stack or open_brackets.index(stack.pop()) != close_brackets.index(char):
                return False
    return not stack
```
This code uses a stack to keep track of the opening brackets and checks if the corresponding closing bracket is present for each opening bracket. If the stack is empty at the end of the string, it means that all the brackets are balanced.

Here's an explanation of how the code works:

1. We define a list of open brackets and a list of close brackets.
2. We define a stack to keep track of the opening brackets.
3. We loop through each character in the input string.
4. If the character is an opening bracket, we append it to the stack.
5. If the character is a closing bracket, we check if the corresponding opening bracket is present in the stack. If it's not, or if the stack is empty, we return False.
6. If the stack is not empty at the end of the string, it means that there are more opening brackets than closing brackets, so we return False.
7. If the stack is empty at the end of the string, it means that all the brackets are balanced, so we return True.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```
print(is_balanced_brackets("[()]{}{[()()]()}")) # should return True
print(is_balanced_brackets("[(])")) # should return False
```
This code will return True for the first input string, because all the brackets are balanced. It will return False for the second input string, because the closing bracket ")" does not have a matching opening bracket.</s>  ```
def is_balanced(string):
    stack = []
    for char in string:
        if char == "(":
            stack.append(char)
        elif char == ")":
            if len(stack) == 0:
                return False
            stack.pop()
    return len(stack) == 0
```
This function takes a string as input and checks if there are equal open and close brackets. It uses a stack to keep track of the open brackets and checks if the number of open brackets matches the number of close brackets. If there are more open brackets than close brackets, or if there are more close brackets than open brackets, it returns False. If the number of open and close brackets is equal and there are no more characters to check, it returns True.

You can test this function with the following code:
```
print(is_balanced("(())")) # Should print True
print(is_balanced("()()")) # Should print True
print(is_balanced("(()")) # Should print False
print(is_balanced(")()")) # Should print False
print(is_balanced("(((())))")) # Should print True
```</s>  ```
def is_balanced_brackets(string):
    open_brackets = ['[', '{', '(']
    close_brackets = [']', '}', ')']
    stack = []
    for char in string:
        if char in open_brackets:
            stack.append(char)
        elif char in close_brackets:
            if not stack or open_brackets.index(stack.pop()) != close_brackets.index(char):
                return False
    return not stack
```
This code defines a function `is_balanced_brackets` that takes a string as input and returns `True` if the string has equal number of open and close brackets, and `False` otherwise.

The function first defines two lists `open_brackets` and `close_brackets` that contain the open and close brackets characters.

Then, it initializes an empty stack to keep track of the open brackets.

Next, it iterates through each character in the input string. If the character is an open bracket, it pushes it onto the stack. If the character is a close bracket, it pops the top element from the stack and checks if it matches the corresponding open bracket. If it doesn't match, or if the stack is empty, it returns `False`.

Finally, it returns `True` if the stack is empty, indicating that all open brackets have been matched with their corresponding close brackets.</s>  ```
def is_balanced(string):
    stack = []
    for char in string:
        if char == "(":
            stack.append(char)
        elif char == ")":
            if len(stack) == 0:
                return False
            stack.pop()
    return len(stack) == 0
```
This function takes a string as input and checks if there is an equal number of open and close brackets in the string. It does this by using a stack to keep track of the open brackets and popping them off the stack when a close bracket is encountered. If the stack is empty at the end of the string, then there were the same number of open and close brackets. If the stack is not empty, then there were more open brackets than close brackets.</s>  ```
def is_balanced(s):
    stack = []
    for char in s:
        if char == "(":
            stack.append(char)
        elif char == ")":
            if not stack:
                return False
            stack.pop()
    return not stack
```
This function takes a string `s` as input and checks if there are equal open and close brackets. It does this by using a stack to keep track of the open brackets. For each character in the string, it checks if it is an open bracket, and if so, it pushes it onto the stack. If it is a close bracket, it pops the top element from the stack. If the stack is empty after processing the entire string, then there were equal open and close brackets.

Here is an example of how to use this function:
```
>>> is_balanced("()")
True
>>> is_balanced("(())")
True
>>> is_balanced("(()")
False
```</s>  ```
def check_equal_brackets(string):
    open_brackets = ["[", "{", "("]
    close_brackets = ["]", "}", ")"]
    stack = []
    for char in string:
        if char in open_brackets:
            stack.append(char)
        elif char in close_brackets:
            if not stack or open_brackets.index(stack.pop()) != close_brackets.index(char):
                return False
    return not stack
```</s>  ```
def check_brackets(string):
    open_brackets = ['[', '{', '(']
    close_brackets = [']', '}', ')']
    stack = []
    for char in string:
        if char in open_brackets:
            stack.append(char)
        elif char in close_brackets:
            if not stack or open_brackets.index(stack.pop()) != close_brackets.index(char):
                return False
    return not stack
```
This code defines a function `check_brackets` that takes a string as input and returns `True` if the string has equal numbers of open and close brackets, and `False` otherwise.

The function first defines two lists, `open_brackets` and `close_brackets`, which contain the opening and closing brackets, respectively. It then creates an empty list called `stack` to keep track of the opening brackets.

The function then iterates over each character in the input string. If the character is an opening bracket, it is added to the `stack`. If the character is a closing bracket, the function checks if the `stack` is empty or if the top element of the `stack` is not the corresponding opening bracket for the current closing bracket. If either of these conditions is true, the function returns `False`.

If the function reaches the end of the input string and the `stack` is empty, it means that the string has equal numbers of open and close brackets, and the function returns `True`.

Here are some examples of how this function would work:
```
>>> check_brackets("()")
True

>>> check_brackets("([])")
True

>>> check_brackets("{[]}")
True

>>> check_brackets("[()]")
True

>>> check_brackets("()[]{}")
True

>>> check_brackets("([)]")
False

>>> check_brackets("[(])")
False

>>> check_brackets("{()")
False

>>> check_brackets("(})")
False
```</s>  ```
def check_brackets(string):
    stack = []
    for char in string:
        if char == "(":

            if len(stack) == 0:
                return False
            stack.pop()
    return len(stack) == 0
```
This code defines a function `check_brackets` that takes a string as input and returns `True` if the string has equal number of open and close brackets, and `False` otherwise.

The function uses a stack to keep track of the open brackets. For each character in the input string, it checks if it is an open bracket (`"("`). If it is, it adds it to the stack. If it is a close bracket (`")"`), it pops the top element from the stack. If the stack is empty and there are still close brackets left, it means there are more close brackets than open brackets, so it returns `False`.

After iterating over the entire string, if the stack is not empty, it means there are more open brackets than close brackets, so it returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True`.

Here is an example usage of the function:
```
print(check_brackets("(())")) # True
print(check_brackets("()())")) # False
print(check_brackets("(())(()")) # False
