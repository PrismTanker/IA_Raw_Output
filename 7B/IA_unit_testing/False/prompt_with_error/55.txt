```</s>  Sure, here's a Python code that generates the n-th Fibonacci number using the recursive formula:
```
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
```
This code uses the recursive formula for Fibonacci numbers, which states that the n-th Fibonacci number is the sum of the (n-1)-th and (n-2)-th Fibonacci numbers. The base case is when n is 1 or 2, in which case the Fibonacci number is simply 1.

You can test this code by calling the `fibonacci` function with different values of `n`:
```
print(fibonacci(5))  # should print 5
print(fibonacci(10))  # should print 55
print(fibonacci(15))  # should print 610
```
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.</s>  ```
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
```
This code uses a recursive approach to calculate the n-th Fibonacci number. The function has a base case where n is 0 or 1, and returns the value of n. For larger values of n, the function recursively calls itself with n-1 and n-2 as arguments, and then adds the results together to get the final answer.</s>  Here is a Python code that solves the problem:
```
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
```
This code uses a recursive approach to calculate the n-th Fibonacci number. The base case is when n is 1 or 2, in which case the result is the same number. For larger values of n, the function calls itself with n-1 and n-2 as arguments, and adds the results together to get the n-th Fibonacci number.

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(2^n), which means that the number of steps required to compute the n-th Fibonacci number grows exponentially with n. This means that computing the n-th Fibonacci number for large values of n can be very slow.

To make the algorithm more efficient, we can use an iterative approach. Here is an example of how we can do this:
```
def fibonacci(n):
    a, b = 0, 1
    for i in range(n):
        a, b = b, a+b
    return a
```
This code uses a loop to iterate n times, and maintains two variables a and b that represent the previous and current values of the Fibonacci sequence. At each iteration, we add the current value of a and b, and assign the result to a. This way, we avoid the exponential growth of the number of steps required to compute the n-th Fibonacci number.

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), which means that the number of steps required to compute the n-th Fibonacci number grows linearly with n. This makes the algorithm much faster for large values of n.</s>  ```
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
```
This code uses a recursive approach to calculate the n-th Fibonacci number. The function checks if the input is less than or equal to 1, and if so, it returns the input. Otherwise, it calls itself twice with the inputs n-1 and n-2, and adds the results together to get the n-th Fibonacci number.

Note that this code uses a recursive approach, which can be slow for large input values. A more efficient approach would be to use a loop to calculate the Fibonacci numbers. Here is an example of how to do that:
```
def fibonacci(n):
    a, b = 0, 1
    for i in range(n):
        a, b = b, a + b
    return a
```
This code uses a loop to calculate the Fibonacci numbers. The variables `a` and `b` are initialized to 0 and 1, respectively. The loop iterates `n` times, and in each iteration, `a` and `b` are updated to the next Fibonacci numbers. The final value of `a` is the n-th Fibonacci number.</s>  ```
def fibonacci(n):
    a, b = 0, 1
    for _ in range(n):
        a, b = b, a + b
    return a
```
This code uses a simple loop to generate the Fibonacci sequence. The `a` and `b` variables are initialized to 0 and 1, respectively, and then updated in each iteration of the loop. The loop continues until the `n`th iteration is reached, at which point `a` contains the `n-1`th Fibonacci number.</s>  ```
def fibonacci(n):
    a, b = 0, 1
    for i in range(n):
        a, b = b, a + b
    return a
```
This code uses a simple iterative approach to calculate the nth Fibonacci number. The variable `a` keeps track of the previous number in the sequence, and `b` keeps track of the current number. The loop iterates over the range of numbers from 0 to n-1, and at each iteration, `a` and `b` are updated according to the Fibonacci recurrence relation. The final value of `a` is the nth Fibonacci number.

This code runs in O(n) time and O(1) space, making it efficient for large values of n.

Note that this code assumes that n is a positive integer. If n can be a negative integer or a float, you may need to modify the code to handle that case.</s>  ```
def fibonacci(n):
    a, b = 0, 1
    for _ in range(n):
        a, b = b, a + b
    return a
```
This code uses a simple iterative approach to calculate the n-th Fibonacci number. It starts by initializing two variables, `a` and `b`, with the values 0 and 1, respectively. It then iterates `n` times, using the following formula to calculate the next Fibonacci number:
```
a, b = b, a + b
```
This formula is equivalent to the mathematical formula for the Fibonacci sequence:
```
F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)
```
At the end of the iteration, the variable `a` will contain the n-th Fibonacci number.</s>  ```
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
```
This code uses a recursive approach to calculate the n-th Fibonacci number. The base case is when n is 1 or 2, in which case the answer is simply 1. Otherwise, the answer is the sum of the (n-1)th and (n-2)th Fibonacci numbers.

Note that this code will not work for large values of n, as it will cause a stack overflow. To avoid this, you can use a dynamic programming approach, where you store the results of previous calculations in a dictionary to avoid recalculating them. Here is an example of how to do this:
```
def fibonacci(n):
    if n in d:
        return d[n]
    else:
        d[n] = fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
        return d[n]

d = {}
print(fibonacci(10))
```
This code will store the results of previous calculations in the dictionary `d`, so that the same result is not calculated multiple times. It will also print the 10th Fibonacci number, which is 55.</s>  To return the n-th Fibonacci number, you can use a recursive approach:
```
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
```
This code uses a recursive function to calculate the n-th Fibonacci number. The function first checks if the input `n` is less than or equal to 1, and if so, returns `n`. Otherwise, it calculates the `n-1`th and `n-2`th Fibonacci numbers using the same function, and returns the sum of those two numbers.

For example, if `n` is 5, the function will first check if 5 is less than or equal to 1, and since it is not, it will call itself with `n-1` and `n-2` as arguments, and pass the results to the addition operator. The first call to the function will return the value of `fibonacci(4)`, which is 3, and the second call will return the value of `fibonacci(3)`, which is 2. Finally, the addition of 3 and 2 will return the value of `fibonacci(5)`, which is 5.

Alternatively, you can use an iterative approach to solve this problem:
```
def fibonacci(n):
    a, b = 0, 1
    for i in range(n):
        a, b = b, a+b
    return a
```
This code uses a loop to calculate the `n`th Fibonacci number. The loop starts with `a` and `b` initialized to 0 and 1, respectively, and then iterates `n` times. In each iteration, the loop swaps the values of `a` and `b` and adds them to get the next Fibonacci number. Finally, the function returns the value of `a`, which is the `n`th Fibonacci number.

For example, if `n` is 5, the loop will iterate 5 times, and the values of `a` and `b` will be 0, 1, 1, 2, and 3, respectively. After the loop finishes, the function returns 3, which is the 5th Fibonacci number.</s>  ```
def fibonacci(n):
    a, b = 0, 1
    for _ in range(n):
        a, b = b, a + b
    return a
```</s>
