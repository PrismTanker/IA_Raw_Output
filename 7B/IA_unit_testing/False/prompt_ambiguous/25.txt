}</s>  Here is a JSON sample that represents a test suite for a hypothetical solution to the prime factorization problem:
```
{
    "test_case_1": {
        "in": {
            "n": 12
        },
        "out": [2, 2, 3]
    },
    "test_case_2": {
        "in": {
            "n": 15
        },
        "out": [3, 5]
    },
    "test_case_3": {
        "in": {
            "n": 24
        },
        "out": [2, 2, 2, 3]
    },
    "test_case_4": {
        "in": {
            "n": 25
        },
        "out": [5, 5]
    },
    "test_case_5": {
        "in": {
            "n": 100
        },
        "out": [2, 2, 5, 5]
    }
}
```
This test suite includes five test cases, each with a unique input `n` and expected output. The inputs and outputs are represented in the JSON sample as follows:

* `test_case_1`: `n = 12`, expected output: `[2, 2, 3]`
* `test_case_2`: `n = 15`, expected output: `[3, 5]`
* `test_case_3`: `n = 24`, expected output: `[2, 2, 2, 3]`
* `test_case_4`: `n = 25`, expected output: `[5, 5]`
* `test_case_5`: `n = 100`, expected output: `[2, 2, 5, 5]`

Note that the JSON uses all lower case for true and false.</s>  To perform prime factorization of a given integer using Python, you can use the `math.factorint` function from the `math` module.
```
import math

def prime_factorization(n):
    factors = math.factorint(n)
    return factors
```
This function takes an integer `n` as input and returns a list of prime factors of `n`. The `math.factorint` function uses the Pollard's rho algorithm to find the prime factors of `n`.

For example, if `n` is 100, the output of the function would be `[2, 2, 5, 5]`, which represents the prime factorization of 100 as 2^2 \* 5^2.

You can also use the `sympy` module to perform prime factorization. The `sympy.ntheory.factor_` function can be used to perform prime factorization of a given integer.
```
from sympy import ntheory

def prime_factorization(n):
    factors = ntheory.factor_(n)
    return factors
```
This function takes an integer `n` as input and returns a list of prime factors of `n`. The `ntheory.factor_` function uses the Pollard's rho algorithm to find the prime factors of `n`.

For example, if `n` is 100, the output of the function would be `[2, 2, 5, 5]`, which represents the prime factorization of 100 as 2^2 \* 5^2.

You can also use the `gmpy2` module to perform prime factorization. The `gmpy2.ifactors` function can be used to perform prime factorization of a given integer.
```
from gmpy2 import ifactors

def prime_factorization(n):
    factors = ifactors(n)
    return factors
```
This function takes an integer `n` as input and returns a list of prime factors of `n`. The `ifactors` function uses the Pollard's rho algorithm to find the prime factors of `n`.

For example, if `n` is 100, the output of the function would be `[2, 2, 5, 5]`, which represents the prime factorization of 100 as 2^2 \* 5^2.</s>  ```
def prime_factorization(n):
    factors = []
    i = 2
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i:
            i += 1
        else:
            n //= i
            factors.append(i)
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)
    return factors
```
This function uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to find the prime factors of a given integer. It starts by initializing a list `factors` to store the prime factors, and a variable `i` to iterate through the range of possible prime factors. It then checks if `n` is divisible by `i` and if it is not, it increments `i` by 1 and continues the loop. If `n` is divisible by `i`, it divides `n` by `i` and appends `i` to the `factors` list. If `n` is not divisible by any prime factors, it is added to the `factors` list as well. Finally, the function returns the `factors` list.</s>  ```
def prime_factorization(n):
    # Find prime factors of n
    prime_factors = []
    i = 2
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i:
            i += 1
        else:
            n //= i
            prime_factors.append(i)
    if n > 1:
        prime_factors.append(n)
    return prime_factors
```
This code uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to find the prime factors of a given integer. It starts by iterating from 2 and checks if the number is divisible by the current number. If it is not divisible, it increments the current number by 1 and checks again. If it is divisible, it divides the number by the current number and adds the current number to the list of prime factors. Finally, if the number is not a prime factor, it adds the number to the list of prime factors.

Note that this code assumes that the input number is a positive integer. If the input number is negative, it will need to be handled differently.</s>
