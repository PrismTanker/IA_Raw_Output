Prompt:  Return list of prime factors of given integer in the order from smallest to largest.
    Each of the factors should be listed number of times corresponding to how many times it appeares in factorization.
    Input number should be equal to the product of all factors
    >>> factorize(8)
    [2, 2, 2]
    >>> factorize(25)
    [5, 5]
    >>> factorize(70)
    [2, 5, 7]

This test suite tests three properties of the `factorize` function:

1. The product of all factors is equal to the input number.
2. The factors are listed in increasing order.
3. Each factor is listed as many times as its value.

The `property_test` function takes a candidate function as input and returns a list of property tests. The `given` decorator is used to define the input values for each property test. The `strategies.integers()` strategy is used to generate random integer inputs for the `factorize` function.</s>
