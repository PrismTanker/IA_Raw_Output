def search(lst):
    """
    You are given a non-empty list of positive integers. Return the greatest integer that is greater than 
    zero, and has a frequency greater than or equal to the value of the integer itself. 
    The frequency of an integer is the number of times it appears in the list.
    If no such a value exist, return -1.

        "out": 10
    }
}
```
This test suite includes five tests, each with a different input list and the expected output for the `search` function. The inputs are of varying sizes and have different frequencies of the elements. The outputs are either the greatest integer that meets the conditions, or -1 if no such value exists.</s>
