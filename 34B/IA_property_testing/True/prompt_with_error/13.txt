Prompt: Return a lowest common multiple of two integers a and b
-------------------
  Here is a test suite using the `hypothesis` library to test a future solution for the problem "Return the lowest common multiple of two integers a and b":
```
from hypothesis import given, strategies

def property_test(candidate_function):
    @given(strategies.integers(), strategies.integers())
    def property_1(a, b):
        assert candidate_function(a, b) % a == 0
        assert candidate_function(a, b) % b == 0

    @given(strategies.integers(), strategies.integers())
    def property_2(a, b):
        assert candidate_function(a, b) == a * b

    return [property_1, property_2]
```
This test suite defines two properties to test:

1. The lowest common multiple of `a` and `b` is a multiple of both `a` and `b`.
2. The lowest common multiple of `a` and `b` is equal to `a * b`.

These properties are defined as functions that take `a` and `b` as input and perform the necessary checks using the `assert` statement. The `property_test` function takes a candidate function as input and returns a list of the property tests.

To use this test suite, you can define a candidate function that implements your solution to the problem and pass it to the `property_test` function. For example:
```
def my_solution(a, b):
    # Your solution here
    return a * b

property_tests = property_test(my_solution)
```
This will run the property tests and report any failures.</s>  ```
def lcm(a, b):
    if a > b:
        greater = a
    else:
        greater = b
    while True:
        if (greater % a == 0) and (greater % b == 0):
            lcm = greater
            break
        greater += 1
    return lcm
```</s>  ```
def lcm(a, b):
    if a > b:
        greater = a
    else:
        greater = b
    while True:
        if (greater % a == 0) and (greater % b == 0):
            lcm = greater
            break
        greater += 1
    return lcm
```
This function takes two integers `a` and `b` as input and returns their lowest common multiple (lcm). The function first checks if `a` is greater than `b`, and if so, sets `greater` to `a`. Otherwise, it sets `greater` to `b`. Then, it starts a loop that increments `greater` by 1 in each iteration, and checks if `greater` is divisible by both `a` and `b`. If it is, it sets `lcm` to `greater` and breaks out of the loop. Finally, it returns `lcm`.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```
print(lcm(12, 15)) # Output: 60
```
This code should pass the following test cases:
```
print(lcm(12, 15)) # Output: 60
print(lcm(12, 18)) # Output: 36
print(lcm(12, 21)) # Output: 252
```
Note that this function assumes that `a` and `b` are positive integers. If you need to handle negative integers or floating-point numbers, you may need to modify the function accordingly.</s>  ```
def lcm(a, b):
    if a > b:
        greater = a
    else:
        greater = b
    while True:
        if (greater % a == 0) and (greater % b == 0):
            lcm = greater
            break
        greater += 1
    return lcm

def lcm(a, b):
    if a > b:
        greater = a
    else:
        greater = b
    while True:
        if (greater % a == 0) and (greater % b == 0):
            lcm = greater
            break
        greater += 1
    return lcm
```</s>  ```

This code uses the fact that the least common multiple (lcm) of two integers `a` and `b` is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both `a` and `b`. The function first checks if `a` is greater than `b`, and if so, sets `greater` to `a`. Otherwise, it sets `greater` to `b`. Then, in a `while` loop, it keeps incrementing `greater` by 1 until it finds the first number that is divisible by both `a` and `b`. This number is the least common multiple of `a` and `b`.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```
print(lcm(12, 15)) # Output: 60
```
This code will return the least common multiple of 12 and 15, which is 60.</s>  ```

    if a > b:

            lcm = greater
            break

This function takes two integers `a` and `b` as input and returns their least common multiple (lcm). The function first checks if `a` is greater than `b`, and if so, sets `greater` to `a`. Otherwise, it sets `greater` to `b`. Then, it enters a loop that increments `greater` by 1 in each iteration until it finds a number that is divisible by both `a` and `b`. Once such a number is found, it is returned as the lcm.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```
print(lcm(12, 15)) # Output: 60

This code will return 60, which is the least common multiple of 12 and 15.</s>  ```

This code calculates the least common multiple (lcm) of two integers `a` and `b` by finding the smallest number that is divisible by both `a` and `b`. It does this by first determining the greater of the two numbers and then iterating up from that number until it finds a number that is divisible by both `a` and `b`. The `while` loop continues until the condition `greater % a == 0` and `greater % b == 0` is `True`, at which point the value of `greater` is assigned to the variable `lcm` and the loop is exited.

Here's an example of how this function would be used:
```
a = 6
b = 8
print(lcm(a, b)) # Output: 24
