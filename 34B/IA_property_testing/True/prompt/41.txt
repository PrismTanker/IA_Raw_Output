-------------------
  Here's a test suite for the `car_race_collision` function:
```python
from hypothesis import given, strategies

def property_test(candidate_function) -> None:
    @given(strategies.integers(min_value=0))
    def property_1(n):
        assert candidate_function(n) >= 0

    @given(strategies.integers(min_value=0, max_value=100))
    def property_2(n):
        assert candidate_function(n) <= 100

    @given(strategies.integers(min_value=0, max_value=100))
    def property_3(n):
        assert candidate_function(n) % 2 == 0

    return [property_1, property_2, property_3]
```
This test suite includes three property tests:

1. The number of collisions should be non-negative.
2. The number of collisions should be at most 100.
3. The number of collisions should be even.

These properties capture the essence of the problem and provide a good starting point for testing the `car_race_collision` function.</s>  ```
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    return n * (n - 1) // 2
```
Explanation:

The number of collisions is equal to the number of pairs of cars that can collide. Since there are `n` cars moving left to right and `n` cars moving right to left, the number of pairs is equal to the number of cars squared, or `n * n`. However, we need to account for the fact that each pair is counted twice (once for each car in the pair), so we divide by 2 to get the final answer of `n * (n - 1) // 2`.</s>  ```
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    # Initialize the number of collisions to 0
    collisions = 0

    # Iterate over the pairs of cars
    for i in range(n):
        # Check if the cars are moving in opposite directions
        if i % 2 == 0:
            # Increment the number of collisions
            collisions += 1

    return collisions
```</s>  ```
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    return n * (n - 1) // 2
```
This solution uses the formula for the number of pairs of elements in a set of size $n$. It can be derived by considering the number of ways to choose two elements from a set of $n$ elements, which is $n \choose 2$. However, since each pair is counted twice (once for each car moving in each direction), we divide by $2$ to get the final answer.</s>  ```
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    return n * (n - 1) // 2
```
Explanation:

The number of collisions is equal to the number of pairs of cars that can collide. Since each car can collide with any other car, the number of collisions is equal to the number of pairs of cars.

The number of pairs of cars is equal to the number of cars choose 2, which is equal to n \* (n - 1) / 2.

Therefore, the number of collisions is equal to n \* (n - 1) / 2.</s>  ```
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    return n * (n - 1) // 2
```
Explanation:

The number of collisions can be calculated using the formula:

(n \* (n - 1)) / 2

This formula calculates the number of pairs of cars that can collide, which is equal to the number of collisions.

For example, if there are 5 cars moving left to right and 5 cars moving right to left, there are 5 \* 5 = 25 pairs of cars that can collide.

The formula works for any value of n.</s>  ```
def car_race_collision(n: int) -> int:
    return n * (n - 1) // 2
```
Explanation:

The number of collisions can be calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series. There are `n` cars moving left to right, and `n` cars moving right to left. Each car on the left side will collide with each car on the right side, for a total of `n * n` potential collisions. However, we need to subtract the number of collisions that occur between the same car (i.e., a car colliding with itself), which is `n`. Therefore, the total number of collisions is `n * (n - 1)`. Since each collision is counted twice (once for each car involved), we need to divide the result by 2 to get the final answer.</s>  ```
def car_race_collision(n):
    return n * (n - 1) // 2
```
Explanation:

The number of collisions is equal to the number of pairs of cars that can collide. Since there are `n` cars moving left to right and `n` cars moving right to left, the total number of pairs is `n * n`. However, we need to subtract the pairs that consist of the same car, which is `n` pairs. Therefore, the total number of collisions is `n * (n - 1) // 2`.</s>  ```

Explanation:

The number of collisions is equal to the number of pairs of cars that can collide. There are n cars moving left to right and n cars moving right to left. Each car can collide with n - 1 other cars, since it can't collide with itself. Therefore, the total number of collisions is n * (n - 1). However, since each collision is counted twice (once from the perspective of each car), we need to divide the result by 2 to get the actual number of collisions. Therefore, the final result is n * (n - 1) // 2.</s>
