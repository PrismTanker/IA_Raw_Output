Prompt: Given the lengths of the three sides of a triangle. Return the area of
    the triangle rounded to 2 decimal points if the three sides form a valid triangle. 
    Otherwise return 0
    Three sides make a valid triangle when the sum of any two sides is greater 
    than the third side.

This code uses the Heron's formula to calculate the area of the triangle. It first checks if the three sides form a valid triangle by checking if the sum of any two sides is greater than the third side. If the sides form a valid triangle, it calculates the area using the Heron's formula and rounds it to 2 decimal points. If the sides do not form a valid triangle, it returns 0.

The `math.sqrt()` function is used to calculate the square root of a number, and the `round()` function is used to round a number to a specified number of decimal points.

Note that this code assumes that the lengths of the three sides are positive and are given in the same units (e.g. all lengths are in meters). If the lengths are in different units, the code may need to be modified accordingly.</s>  ```

def get_triangle_area(a, b, c):
    if a + b > c and b + c > a and a + c > b:
        s = (a + b + c) / 2
        area = math.sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c))
        return round(area, 2)

This function takes in three sides of a triangle as input, and checks if they form a valid triangle by ensuring that the sum of any two sides is greater than the third side. If the triangle is valid, it calculates the area using the Heron's formula, and rounds the result to 2 decimal points. If the triangle is not valid, it returns 0.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```
print(get_triangle_area(3, 4, 5))  # Output: 6.0
print(get_triangle_area(2, 3, 4))  # Output: 0.0
```
Note that the `math.sqrt()` function is used to calculate the square root of a number, which is necessary for the Heron's formula. The `round()` function is used to round the area to 2 decimal points.</s>  ```

        p = (a + b + c) / 2
        area = math.sqrt(p * (p - a) * (p - b) * (p - c))

```
This function takes in three side lengths as input and checks if they form a valid triangle using the condition that the sum of any two sides is greater than the third side. If the sides form a valid triangle, the function calculates the area of the triangle using the Heron's formula and returns the rounded result to 2 decimal points. If the sides do not form a valid triangle, the function returns 0.

The `math` module is used to calculate the square root and round the result to 2 decimal points.</s>  ```

    if a + b > c and b + c > a and a + c > b:
        p = (a + b + c) / 2

```

This code uses the Heron's formula to calculate the area of the triangle. It first checks if the three sides form a valid triangle by checking if the sum of any two sides is greater than the third side. If the sides form a valid triangle, the formula is used to calculate the area, which is then rounded to 2 decimal points. If the sides do not form a valid triangle, 0 is returned.

Here are some test cases:
```
print(get_area(3, 4, 5)) # 6.0
print(get_area(4, 3, 5)) # 6.0
print(get_area(3, 5, 4)) # 6.0
print(get_area(3, 4, 2)) # 0.0
print(get_area(4, 2, 3)) # 0.0
print(get_area(2, 3, 4)) # 0.0

def get_triangle_area(a, b, c):
    if a + b > c and b + c > a and a + c > b:
        p = (a + b + c) / 2
        area = (p * (p - a) * (p - b) * (p - c)) ** 0.5
        return round(area, 2)
    else:
        return 0
```
This code defines a function `get_triangle_area` that takes three sides of a triangle as input and returns the area of the triangle rounded to 2 decimal points if the three sides form a valid triangle. Otherwise, it returns 0.

The function first checks if the three sides form a valid triangle using the condition `a + b > c and b + c > a and a + c > b`. If the condition is true, it calculates the semi-perimeter `p` and the area of the triangle using Heron's formula: `p * (p - a) * (p - b) * (p - c) ** 0.5`. The area is then rounded to 2 decimal points using `round(area, 2)`.

If the three sides do not form a valid triangle, the function returns 0.

Here is an example usage of the function:
```
print(get_triangle_area(3, 4, 5))  # Output: 6.00
print(get_triangle_area(1, 2, 3))  # Output: 0.00
