This code uses a simple trial division algorithm to check whether a number is prime. It first checks if the number is less than or equal to 1, and returns False if it is. Then, it loops through all the numbers from 2 to the square root of the given number (rounded up to the nearest integer), and checks if the number is divisible by any of these numbers. If it is not divisible by any of these numbers, it returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.

Note that this algorithm is not the most efficient way to check for primality, but it is a simple and effective way to solve this problem.</s>  ```

This code uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to determine whether a given number is prime. The algorithm works by iterating from 2 to the square root of the number being checked, and checking if the number is divisible by any of the numbers in that range. If the number is not divisible by any of those numbers, it is prime.

The `int(n ** 0.5)` part is used to calculate the square root of the number, as the `**` operator only works with integers.

This code passes all the test cases provided.</s>  ```

```
This code uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to determine whether a given number is prime. The algorithm starts by checking if the number is less than or equal to 1, and if so, it returns False. Then, it loops through all numbers between 2 and the square root of the input number, and checks if the input number is divisible by any of them. If it is, it returns False. Otherwise, it returns True.

This algorithm is efficient and runs in O(n log log n) time, making it suitable for large numbers.</s>  ```

```
This code uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to determine if a number is prime. The algorithm starts by checking if the number is less than or equal to 1, in which case it is not prime. Then, it iterates from 2 to the square root of the number, incrementing by 1 each time, and checks if the number is divisible by any of the numbers in the range. If it is not divisible by any of these numbers, it is prime. If it is divisible by any of these numbers, it is not prime. The final return statement determines whether the number is prime or not based on the results of the loop.</s>  ```

This code uses a simple trial division method to determine if a number is prime. It first checks if the number is less than 2, since all prime numbers greater than 2 are of the form 6k +/- 1, and 2 is the only even prime number. Then, it loops through all the numbers between 2 and the square root of the input number, and checks if the input number is divisible by any of them. If it is, it returns False, otherwise it returns True.</s>  ```

This function uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to determine whether a given number is prime. The algorithm starts by checking if the number is less than or equal to 1, in which case it is not prime. Then, it checks if the number is divisible by any number between 2 and the square root of the number, inclusive. If the number is divisible by any of these numbers, it is not prime, and the function returns False. If the number is not divisible by any of these numbers, it is prime, and the function returns True.

Here are some examples of the function in action:
```
>>> is_prime(6)
False
>>> is_prime(101)
True
>>> is_prime(11)
True
>>> is_prime(13441)
True
>>> is_prime(61)
True
>>> is_prime(4)
False
>>> is_prime(1)
False

This code uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to determine if a number is prime. The algorithm starts by iterating from 2 to the square root of the input number, and for each number i in this range, it checks if the input number is divisible by i. If the input number is divisible by any number in this range, it is not prime and the function returns False. If the input number is not divisible by any number in this range, it is prime and the function returns True.

The code also includes a special case for numbers less than or equal to 1, which are not prime.

This code passes all the test cases provided.</s>  ```

```

This code uses the `math.sqrt()` function to determine the square root of the input number, and then checks if it is an integer. If it is, it returns `False`. Otherwise, it checks if the number is divisible by any number between 2 and the square root of the input number, and returns `False` if it is divisible. If it is not divisible, it returns `True`.

This code passes all of the test cases provided:

            return False
    return True
```
This code uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to determine if a number is prime. The algorithm works as follows:

1. The function checks if the input number is less than 2, and returns False if it is.
2. The function then iterates from 2 to the square root of the input number, and checks if the input number is divisible by any number in the range.
3. If the input number is not divisible by any number in the range, it is prime, and the function returns True.
4. If the input number is divisible by any number in the range, it is not prime, and the function returns False.

This function uses the `range` function to generate a range of numbers from 2 to the square root of the input number, and the `int` function to convert the square root to an integer. The `**` operator is used to calculate the square root of the input number.

This function is efficient for large input numbers, as it only needs to check the divisibility of numbers up to the square root of the input number. For example, for the input number 13441, the function only needs to check the divisibility of numbers up to 117, which is much faster than checking the divisibility of all numbers up to 13441.

Note that this function assumes that the input number is a positive integer. If the input number is a negative integer, the function will return False, even if the input number is prime. If the input number is not an integer, the function will return False, as it is not possible to determine if a non-integer is prime or not.</s>
