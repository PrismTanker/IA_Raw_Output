```
{
    "test_is_prime": {
        "in": {
            "n": 7
        },
        "out": true
    },
    "test_is_not_prime": {
        "in": {
            "n": 8

    },
    "test_large_prime": {
        "in": {
            "n": 1009
        },
        "out": true
    },
    "test_small_composite": {

            "n": 12
        },
        "out": false
    }
}
```
This test suite includes four tests:

* `test_is_prime`: Tests if the number 7 is prime (it is).
* `test_is_not_prime`: Tests if the number 8 is prime (it is not).
* `test_large_prime`: Tests if the number 1009 is prime (it is).
* `test_small_composite`: Tests if the number 12 is prime (it is not).</s>  ```
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```</s>  ```
def is_prime(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```
This code uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to determine whether a given number is prime or not. It starts by checking if the number is less than or equal to 1, and if so, it returns False. Otherwise, it iterates from 2 to the square root of the number and checks if the number is divisible by any of the numbers in the range. If the number is divisible by any number in the range, it returns False, indicating that the number is not prime. If the number is not divisible by any number in the range, it returns True, indicating that the number is prime.</s>  ```
def is_prime(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```
This function uses a simple loop to check if a given number is prime. It starts by checking if the number is less than or equal to 1, and if it is, it returns false. Otherwise, it iterates from 2 to the square root of the number and checks if the number is divisible by any of these numbers. If it finds a divisor, it returns false. If it makes it through the entire loop without finding a divisor, it returns true.

This function is efficient because it only checks up to the square root of the number, which is the largest possible divisor. It also avoids checking divisibility by 0 and 1, which are not prime numbers. Additionally, this function is easy to understand and debug, making it a good solution for this problem.</s>  ```
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```</s>  ```
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```
This code uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to determine whether a given number is prime. The algorithm works by iteratively marking as composite (not prime) any number that is divisible by a prime number less than or equal to the square root of the number. After iterating through all the prime numbers less than or equal to the square root of the number, if the number is not marked as composite, it must be prime.

The code first checks if the number is less than 2, as 0 and 1 are not prime. If the number is less than 2, it returns False.

Then, it iterates through the range of numbers from 2 to the square root of the number (inclusive) and checks if the number is divisible by any of the prime numbers less than or equal to the square root of the number. If the number is divisible by any of the prime numbers, it marks it as composite and continues to the next number.

Finally, if the number is not marked as composite after iterating through all the prime numbers less than or equal to the square root of the number, it must be prime. Therefore, the function returns True, and False otherwise.

Note that the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm is an efficient algorithm for determining whether a number is prime, and it is widely used in many applications, including cryptography and coding challenges like this one.</s>  Here is a Python function that uses the Euclidean algorithm to determine if a given number is prime:
```
def is_prime(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```
This function uses the Euclidean algorithm to determine if a given number is prime by iteratively dividing the number by each integer between 2 and the square root of the number. If the number is divisible by any integer between 2 and the square root of the number, it is not prime.

For example, if we call the function with the number 17, it will return `True` because 17 is prime. If we call the function with the number 4, it will return `False` because 4 is not prime.

You can test this function by calling it with different numbers and printing the result:
```
print(is_prime(17))  # prints True
print(is_prime(4))   # prints False
```
Note that this function uses the `range` function to generate a sequence of numbers between 2 and the square root of the number. The `int` function is used to convert the result of the square root operation to an integer. The `for` loop iterates over the sequence of numbers and checks if the number is divisible by any of them. If the number is not divisible by any of the numbers in the sequence, it is prime.

This function is more efficient than other methods for determining if a number is prime because it only requires dividing the number by a small number of integers between 2 and the square root of the number. This makes it faster than other methods that require dividing the number by all integers up to the square root of the number.</s>  ```

        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
