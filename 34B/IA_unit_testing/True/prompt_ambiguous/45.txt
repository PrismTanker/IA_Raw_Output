        "in": {
            "base": 3,

This test suite includes several tests for different cases, including:

* `test_base_case`: Tests the base case of a triangle with a base of 3 and a height of 4.
* `test_larger_base`: Tests a triangle with a larger base (10) and the same height (5).
* `test_larger_height`: Tests a triangle with a larger height (10) and the same base (5).
* `test_negative_base`: Tests a triangle with a negative base (-3) and the same height (4).
* `test_negative_height`: Tests a triangle with a negative height (-4) and the same base (3).
* `test_zero_base`: Tests a triangle with a base of 0 and a height of 4.
* `test_zero_height`: Tests a triangle with a height of 0 and a base of 3.

Each test includes a set of input parameters (base and height) and an expected output (area). The test suite is structured as a JSON object with the test names as keys and the input parameters and expected output as values.</s>  ```
def triangle_area(base, height):
    return (base * height) / 2
```

This function takes in two parameters, `base` and `height`, and returns the area of the triangle using the formula `A = (base * height) / 2`.</s>  ```
def triangle_area(base, height):
    return base * height / 2
```

Note: This code assumes that the base and height of the triangle are given as positive numbers. If the base is negative, the area will be negative. If the height is negative, the area will be positive.</s>  ```
def triangle_area(base, height):
    return base * height / 2
```

This code defines a function `triangle_area` that takes two arguments: `base` and `height`. It calculates the area of a triangle using the formula `base * height / 2` and returns the result.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```
print(triangle_area(5, 6))  # prints 15.0
```
Note that the function assumes that the base and height are of the same units, and the result is also in the same units. For example, if the base and height are in meters, the result will be in square meters. If the base and height are in feet, the result will be in square feet.</s>  ```
def triangle_area(base, height):
    return 0.5 * base * height
```

This function takes in two parameters: `base` and `height`. It then calculates the area of the triangle using the formula `0.5 * base * height` and returns the result.

Here's an example of how you could use this function:
```
print(triangle_area(5, 6))  # prints 15.0
```</s>  ```
def triangle_area(base, height):
    return (base * height) / 2
```
This function takes in two parameters, `base` and `height`, and returns the area of the triangle. The formula for the area of a triangle is `A = (base * height) / 2`.</s>  ```
def triangle_area(base, height):
    return (base * height) / 2
```

This function takes in two parameters, `base` and `height`, and returns the area of the triangle using the formula: `area = (base * height) / 2`.

Here is an example usage of the function:
```
print(triangle_area(3, 4)) # Output: 6.0
```
This will output the area of the triangle with a base of 3 and a height of 4, which is 6.0.</s>  ```
def triangle_area(base, height):
    return base * height / 2
```
This function takes in two parameters, `base` and `height`, and returns the area of the triangle. The area of a triangle is calculated by multiplying the base and height and dividing by 2.

Here is an example of how to use the function:
```
print(triangle_area(5, 6)) # Output: 15.0
```
This code will print the area of a triangle with a base of 5 and a height of 6, which is 15.0.</s>  ```
def triangle_area(base, height):
    return (base * height) / 2
```

This function takes in two arguments: `base` and `height`, which are the base and height of a triangle, respectively. It returns the area of the triangle, which is calculated by multiplying the base and height and dividing by 2.

Here's an example of how to use this function:
```
print(triangle_area(5, 6))  # Output: 15.0
```
This will print the area of a triangle with a base of 5 units and a height of 6 units, which is 15.0 square units.</s>  ```
def get_triangle_area(base, height):
    return (base * height) / 2
```
This function takes in the base and height of a triangle as inputs, and returns the area of the triangle using the formula: area = (base * height) / 2.

Here's an example of how you can use this function:
```
# Test case 1:
base = 3
height = 4
print(get_triangle_area(base, height)) # Output: 6.0

# Test case 2:
base = 5
height = 6
print(get_triangle_area(base, height)) # Output: 15.0
```</s>  ```
def triangle_area(base, height):
    return (base * height) / 2
```

This function takes in two arguments, `base` and `height`, and returns the area of a triangle with the given base and height. The formula for the area of a triangle is `A = (base * height) / 2`.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```
print(triangle_area(3, 4))  # Output: 6.0
```
This will output `6.0`, which is the area of the triangle with a base of 3 and a height of 4.</s>
