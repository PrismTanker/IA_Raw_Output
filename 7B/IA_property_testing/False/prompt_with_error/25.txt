This test suite has two property tests:

1. `property_1`: This property test checks that the function returns a list of prime factors of the input number in the order from smallest to largest. It does this by checking that the factors are all integers, that they are all greater than 2, that they are all prime factors of the input number, and that they are in the correct order.
2. `property_2`: This property test checks that the function returns a list of unique prime factors of the input number. It does this by checking that the list of factors has no duplicates.

These two property tests cover all the possible cases that a future solution to this problem could encounter.</s>  To solve this problem, we can use the `prime_factors` function from the `math` module. This function returns a list of prime factors of a given integer in the order from smallest to largest.

Here is an example code snippet:
```
from math import prime_factors

def get_prime_factors(n):
    factors = []
    for factor in prime_factors(n):
        factors.append(factor)
    return factors

print(get_prime_factors(120))  # Output: [2, 2, 2, 3, 5]
```
In this code, we define a function `get_prime_factors` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns a list of its prime factors in the order from smallest to largest. We use the `prime_factors` function from the `math` module to get the prime factors of `n`. We then append each prime factor to the `factors` list in the order from smallest to largest. Finally, we return the `factors` list.

Note that the `prime_factors` function only works for positive integers. If the input number is negative, the function will return an empty list. Also, the function only works for integers up to a certain limit. If the input number is larger than that limit, the function will raise a `ValueError`.</s>  To find the prime factors of a given integer in the order from smallest to largest, you can use the `math.factor()` function from the `math` module in Python.

Here's an example code snippet:
```python
import math

def prime_factors(n):
    factors = []
    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            factors.append(i)
            n //= i
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)
    return factors
```
This function takes an integer `n` as input, and returns a list of prime factors of `n` in the order from smallest to largest. The function uses a loop to iterate over the range of prime numbers less than or equal to the square root of `n`, and checks if `n` is divisible by each prime number in the range. If a prime number `p` divides `n`, it is added to the list of prime factors, and `n` is divided by `p` to remove the factor. The loop continues until `n` is 1, and the remaining prime factor is added to the list.

For example, if `n = 120`, the function will return the list `[2, 2, 3, 5]`, which are the prime factors of `120` in the order from smallest to largest.</s>  ```
def prime_factors(n):
    factors = []
    i = 2
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i:
            i += 1
        else:
            n //= i
            factors.append(i)
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)
    return factors
```
This function uses a simple loop to find the prime factors of a given integer `n`. It starts by setting `i` to 2 and increments it by 1 each time through the loop. It checks if `n` is divisible by `i` and if it is, it divides `n` by `i` and adds `i` to the list of prime factors. If `n` is not divisible by `i`, it increments `i` and continues the loop. Once the loop is complete, if `n` is greater than 1, it means it is a prime factor and it is added to the list of prime factors. Finally, the function returns the list of prime factors in the order from smallest to largest.</s>  ```
def get_prime_factors(n):
    factors = []
    while n > 1:
        for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
            if n % i == 0:
                factors.append(i)
                n = n // i
                break
    return factors
```
Explanation:

The function `get_prime_factors` takes an integer `n` as input and returns a list of its prime factors in the order from smallest to largest.

The algorithm used in this function is called the Sieve of Eratosthenes. It works by iteratively marking as composite (not prime) any number that is divisible by a prime number less than or equal to the square root of `n`. Once all numbers less than or equal to the square root of `n` have been marked as composite, the remaining numbers in the range are prime.

The function starts by initializing an empty list `factors` to store the prime factors of `n`. It then loops through the range of numbers from 2 to the square root of `n` (inclusive). For each number `i` in the range, it checks if `n` is divisible by `i`. If it is, it marks `i` as composite by appending it to the `factors` list and dividing `n` by `i`. The loop continues until all numbers less than or equal to the square root of `n` have been marked as composite. The remaining numbers in the range are the prime factors of `n`.

For example, if `n` is equal to 120, the function will return `[2, 2, 2, 3, 5]` because 120 can be factored as 2^2 \* 2^1 \* 3 \* 5.</s>  ```
def prime_factors(n):
    factors = []
    i = 2
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i:
            i += 1
        else:
            n //= i
            factors.append(i)
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)
    return factors
```
This code uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to find all the prime factors of a given integer. It starts by iterating from 2 to the square root of the input number, and checks if the number is divisible by each prime factor. If it is not divisible, it increments the factor by 1 and continues the loop. If it is divisible, it divides the input number by the current factor, and appends the factor to the list of prime factors. Finally, it returns the list of prime factors in the order from smallest to largest.</s>  ```
def get_prime_factors(n):
    factors = []
    while n % 2 == 0:
        factors.append(2)
        n //= 2
    for i in range(3, int(n ** 0.5) + 1, 2):
        while n % i == 0:
            factors.append(i)
            n //= i
    if n > 2:
        factors.append(n)
    return factors
```
This code uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to find all prime factors of a given integer. It starts by dividing the number by 2 and appending 2 to the list of factors if it is even. It then iterates over the remaining odd numbers from 3 to the square root of the number, dividing the number by each odd number and appending it to the list of factors if it divides the number evenly. Finally, it checks if the number is greater than 2 and appends it to the list of factors if it is. The function returns the list of prime factors in the order from smallest to largest.</s>  To solve this problem, we can use the Euclidean algorithm to find the prime factors of a given integer. The Euclidean algorithm is an efficient algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers, and it can be modified to find the prime factors of a number.

Here is the Python code to solve the problem:
```
def prime_factors(n):
    factors = []
    while n > 1:
        for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
            if n % i == 0:
                factors.append(i)
                n = n // i
                break
        else:
            factors.append(n)
            break
    return factors
```
This code uses a while loop to repeatedly divide the input number `n` by the smallest prime factor it contains, and appends the prime factor to a list. The list of prime factors is returned at the end.

For example, if we call the function with the input `n = 120`, it will return `[2, 2, 2, 3, 5]`, which are the prime factors of `120` in the order from smallest to largest.

Note that this code assumes that the input number is a positive integer. If the input number is negative, we need to handle the negative sign separately.</s>  To find the prime factors of a given integer, you can use the `primeFactors()` function in the `math` module. This function returns a list of prime factors in the order from smallest to largest.
```
import math

def primeFactors(n):
    return list(math.primeFactors(n))
```
For example, if `n` is equal to 12, the function will return `[2, 2, 3]`.

You can also use the `factorint()` function in the `sympy` module to find the prime factors of a given integer. This function returns a dictionary with the prime factors as the keys and their multiplicities as the values.
```
from sympy import factorint

def primeFactors(n):
    return factorint(n)
```
For example, if `n` is equal to 12, the function will return `{2: 2, 3: 1}`.

Both of these functions work by iteratively dividing the input number by the smallest prime factor until it is 1. The remaining factors are the prime factors of the input number.</s>  To find the prime factors of a given integer, we can use the Euclidean algorithm. The Euclidean algorithm is a method for finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers, and it can be used to find all prime factors of a number.

Here is an example of how to use the Euclidean algorithm to find the prime factors of a number:
```
def get_prime_factors(n):
    factors = []
    while n > 1:
        for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
            if n % i == 0:
                factors.append(i)
                n = n // i
                break
        else:
            factors.append(n)
            break
    return factors
```
This function takes an integer `n` as input, and it returns a list of all prime factors of `n` in the order from smallest to largest.

To use this function, you can call it with a value for `n` and store the result in a variable, like this:
```
prime_factors = get_prime_factors(120)
print(prime_factors)
```
This would print the list `[2, 2, 3, 5]`, which are the prime factors of 120.

Note that this function is not the most efficient way to find the prime factors of a number, but it is a simple and straightforward way to do it. There are more efficient algorithms for finding prime factors, such as the Sieve of Eratosthenes, but this one is a good starting point for understanding the concept.</s>  ```
def prime_factors(n):
    factors = []
    i = 2
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i:
            i += 1
        else:
            n //= i
            factors.append(i)
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)
    return factors
```
This code uses a simple algorithm to find the prime factors of a given integer. It starts by initializing a list to store the prime factors, and then loops through all possible factors, starting from 2 and incrementing by 1. For each factor that divides the input number without leaving a remainder, it updates the input number by dividing it by the factor. If the input number is greater than 1, it means that there is a prime factor that was not found earlier, and it is added to the list of prime factors. Finally, the function returns the list of prime factors in the order from smallest to largest.</s>

This code uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to find all prime factors of a given number. It starts by dividing the number by 2 and appending the result to a list of factors. It then iterates over the range of odd numbers less than or equal to the square root of the number, and divides the number by each odd number, appending the result to the list of factors.

This code uses a combination of trial division and the Euclidean algorithm to find the prime factors of the given integer. It starts by checking if the number is even, and if so, adds 2 to the list of prime factors and divides the number by 2. It then checks if the number is odd, and if so, starts a loop that repeatedly divides the number by the current prime factor (starting from 3) and adds the prime factor to the list of prime factors until the number is divisible by all prime factors less than or equal to its square root. Finally, if the number is not divisible by any prime factors less than or equal to its square root, it is added to the list of prime factors.

Note that this code assumes that the input number is a positive integer. If the input number is negative or a floating-point number, the code will need to be modified to handle those cases as well.</s>  ```

This code satisfies the constraints and properties mentioned in the problem statement.

The `prime_factors` function takes an integer `n` as input and returns a list of all the prime factors of `n` in the order from smallest to largest. The function uses a simple algorithm that repeatedly divides `n` by the smallest prime factor that is less than or equal to its square root. If `n` is not divisible by any prime factors less than or equal to its square root, the loop terminates and `n` is returned as a prime factor.

The `property_test` function is a testing function that takes a candidate function `candidate_function` as input and returns a list of property tests. The first property test, `property_1`, checks that the input `n` is an integer and that the output `factors` is a list of integers. The second property test, `property_2`, checks that the output `factors` is a list with no duplicates.

The `property_test` function is used to test the `prime_factors` function by passing it as an argument to the `given` decorator from the `hypothesis` module. The `hypothesis` module generates random integers as input to the `prime_factors` function, and the `property_test` function checks that the output `factors` satisfies the desired properties.</s>  ```
def get_prime_factors(n):
    factors = []
    i = 2
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i:
            i += 1

            factors.append(i)
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)
    return factors
```
This code uses a simple loop to iterate over the prime factors of the input number `n`. The loop starts with `i = 2`, which is the smallest prime factor, and continues until `i * i > n`. At each iteration, if `n` is not divisible by `i`, the loop increments `i` by 1 and continues. If `n` is divisible by `i`, the loop divides `n` by `i` and appends `i` to the list of prime factors. Once the loop terminates, if `n` is greater than 1, it is added to the list of prime factors.

The `get_prime_factors` function returns the list of prime factors in the order from smallest to largest.</s>  ```

Note that this function uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to find all prime factors of a given integer. It starts by dividing the number by 2 and appending the result to the list of factors if it is a prime number. Then, it iterates through all odd numbers up to the square root of the remaining number and divides the number by each prime factor, appending the result to the list of factors if it is a prime number. Finally, if the number is not 1, it is added to the list of factors.</s>  ```
