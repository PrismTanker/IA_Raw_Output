Prompt: Input to this function is a string containing multiple groups of nested parentheses. Your goal is to
    separate those group into separate strings and return the list of those.
    Separate groups are balanced (each open brace is properly closed) and not nested within each other
    Ignore any spaces in the input string.
-------------------
  Sure! Here's a test suite for the hypothetical future solution using the Hypothesis library:
```
from hypothesis import given, strategies

def property_test(candidate_function) -> None:
    @given(strategies.from_regex(r'\([^()]*\)+', fullmatch=True))
    def property_1(input_string):
        result = candidate_function(input_string)
        assert len(result) == len(input_string)
        for i in range(len(result)):
            assert result[i] in ['(', ')']
        assert ''.join(result) == input_string

    @given(strategies.from_regex(r'\([^()]*\)+', fullmatch=True))
    def property_2(input_string):
        result = candidate_function(input_string)
        assert all(c in '()' for c in result)
        assert all(result.count(c) == result.count('(') for c in '()')
        assert all(result.count(c) == result.count(')') for c in '()')

    return [property_1, property_2]
```
This test suite uses the `from_regex` strategy from Hypothesis to generate input strings that match the given regular expression. The first property test `property_1` checks that the returned list has the same length as the input string and that each element in the list is either '(' or ')'. The second property test `property_2` checks that all the characters in the returned list are either '(' or ')', that the number of '(' is equal to the number of ')' and that the number of ')' is equal to the number of '(' in the input string.

Note that this test suite assumes that the input string is a valid string containing balanced parentheses. If the input string is not valid, these tests may not cover all possible cases.</s>  ```
import re

def separate_nested_groups(s):
    # Use regular expressions to match balanced parentheses
    pattern = r"\([^()]*\)"
    matches = re.findall(pattern, s)
    return [match[0] for match in matches]
```</s>  ```
def separate_groups(s):
    result = []
    current_group = ""
    for char in s:
        if char == "(":
            current_group += char
        elif char == ")":
            current_group += char
            result.append(current_group)
            current_group = ""
        else:
            current_group += char
    return result
```
This function uses a stack to keep track of the current group of parentheses. When a "(" is encountered, it is added to the current group. When a ")" is encountered, it is added to the current group and the current group is added to the result list. If a non-parenthesis character is encountered, it is added to the current group.

Here is an example usage of the function:
```
separate_groups("((a b) (c d))")
# Output: ["(a b)", "(c d)"]
```
This function assumes that the input string is well-formed, meaning that all parentheses are balanced and not nested within each other. If the input string is not well-formed, the function may produce unexpected results.</s>  ```
def separate_groups(s):
    open_paren_count = 0
    start_index = 0
    groups = []
    for i, char in enumerate(s):
        if char == "(":
            open_paren_count += 1
        elif char == ")":
            open_paren_count -= 1
            if open_paren_count == 0:
                groups.append(s[start_index:i+1])
                start_index = i + 1
    return groups
```</s>  ```
def separate_nested_groups(s):
    result = []
    stack = []
    current_group = ""
    for char in s:
        if char == "(":
            stack.append(char)

                current_group = ""
        else:
            current_group += char
    return result
```
This function uses a stack to keep track of the opening and closing parentheses. When a closing parenthesis is encountered, it pops the corresponding opening parenthesis from the stack, and if the stack is empty, it means that the group is complete and it adds the current group to the result list.

Example:
```
s = "((a(b)c)d(e(f)g)h)"
print(separate_nested_groups(s)) # Output: ['(a(b)c)', '(e(f)g)']
```
This code assumes that the input string is balanced, meaning that every opening parenthesis has a corresponding closing parenthesis. If the input string is not balanced, the function will not work correctly.</s>  ```
import re

def separate_groups(s):
    return re.findall(r'\([^()]*\)', s)
```
Explanation:

The regular expression `\([^()]*\)` matches a string that starts with a left parenthesis, followed by any number of characters that are not left or right parentheses, and ends with a right parenthesis. The `findall` method returns a list of all non-overlapping matches in the input string.

For example, if the input string is `"(1 + 2) * (3 + 4)"`, the function will return `["(1 + 2)", "(3 + 4)"]`.</s>  ```
import re

def get_nested_groups(s):
    pattern = r"\((?:[^()]|(?R))*+\)"
    return re.findall(pattern, s)
```
Explanation:

* `(?R)` is a recursive pattern that matches the entire regular expression again.
* `(?:[^()]|(?R))*+` matches any character that is not a parenthesis or a nested group.
* `\((?:[^()]|(?R))*+\)` matches a group of nested parentheses.
* `re.findall(pattern, s)` returns a list of all matches of the pattern in the string `s`.

Example:
```
s = "((a) (b) (c)) (d) (e) (f)"
print(get_nested_groups(s)) # Output: ["(a) (b) (c)", "(d)", "(e)", "(f)"]
```</s>  ```
def separate_nested_groups(s):
    result = []
    stack = []
    current_group = ""
    for char in s:
        if char == "(":
            stack.append(char)
        elif char == ")":
            stack.pop()
            if not stack:
                result.append(current_group)
                current_group = ""
        else:
            current_group += char
    return result
```
This function uses a stack to keep track of the opening and closing parentheses. When a closing parenthesis is encountered, it checks if the stack is empty, and if it is, it adds the current group to the result list and resets the current group to an empty string.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```
s = "((a b) (c d) (e f))"
result = separate_nested_groups(s)
print(result) # Output: ['(a b)', '(c d)', '(e f)']
```
This code assumes that the input string is well-formed, meaning that all opening parentheses are properly closed. If the input string is not well-formed, the function may not work correctly.</s>  ```
import re

def separate_balanced_groups(string):
    """
    Given a string containing multiple groups of nested parentheses,

    """
    pattern = r"\([^()]*\)"
    matches = re.findall(pattern, string)
    return matches
```
This function uses regular expressions to find all groups of balanced parentheses in the input string. The regular expression `r"\([^()]*\)"` matches a single group of balanced parentheses. The `re.findall` function returns a list of all matches in the input string.

Here's an example of how the function works:
```
string = "((a b) (c d)) ((e f) (g h))"
result = separate_balanced_groups(string)
print(result)  # [['(a b)', '(c d)'], ['(e f)', '(g h)']]
```</s>  ```
def get_balanced_groups(s):
    result = []
    stack = []
    for char in s:
        if char == '(':
            stack.append(char)
        elif char == ')':
            if not stack:
                result.append(''.join(stack))
                stack = []
            else:
                stack.pop()
    if stack:
        result.append(''.join(stack))
    return result
```
Example:
```
s = "((()()))"
print(get_balanced_groups(s)) # [['((()()))']]

s = "(()())(())"
print(get_balanced_groups(s)) # [['(()())', '(())']]

s = "((()())(()))"
print(get_balanced_groups(s)) # [['((()())', '(()))']]
```</s>  ```
import re

def separate_nested_groups(s):
    return re.findall(r'\((?:[^()]++|(?R))*\)', s)
```
Explanation:

* `re.findall` returns a list of all non-overlapping matches of the regular expression in the string `s`.
* The regular expression `r'\((?:[^()]++|(?R))*\)'` matches a string that starts with a `(`, followed by any number of characters that are not `(` or `)`, and then a `)`. The `(?R)` is a recursive call to the entire regular expression, which allows us to match nested groups.
* The `++` after the character class `[^()]` is a possessive quantifier, which means that the regex engine will not backtrack into the character class to find a match. This is necessary to prevent the regex from matching too much, and to ensure that each group is properly balanced.

For example, if the input string is `"((a) (b) (c)) ((d) (e))"`, the output will be `["(a) (b) (c)", "(d) (e)"]`.</s>

  Sure! Here's a test suite using the Hypothesis library to test a future solution for the problem:
```
from hypothesis import given, strategies

def property_test(candidate_function):
    @given(strategies.from_regex(r'\((?:[^()]|(?1))*\)'))
    def property_1(input_string):
        # Check that the input string is a valid balanced string of parentheses
        assert candidate_function(input_string) == True

    @given(strategies.from_regex(r'(?:[^()]|(?1))*'))
    def property_2(input_string):
        # Check that the input string is not a valid balanced string of parentheses
        assert candidate_function(input_string) == False

    @given(strategies.from_regex(r'\((?:[^()]|(?1))*\)\((?:[^()]|(?1))*\)'))
    def property_3(input_string):
        # Check that the input string is a valid balanced string of parentheses with multiple groups
        assert candidate_function(input_string) == True

    @given(strategies.from_regex(r'\((?:[^()]|(?1))*\)\((?:[^()]|(?1))*\)'))
    def property_4(input_string):
        # Check that the input string is a valid balanced string of parentheses with multiple groups and ignore spaces
        assert candidate_function(input_string) == True

    return [property_1, property_2, property_3, property_4]
```
This test suite includes four property tests:

1. `property_1` checks that the input string is a valid balanced string of parentheses.
2. `property_2` checks that the input string is not a valid balanced string of parentheses.
3. `property_3` checks that the input string is a valid balanced string of parentheses with multiple groups.
4. `property_4` checks that the input string is a valid balanced string of parentheses with multiple groups and ignores spaces.

Each property test uses the `given` decorator from the Hypothesis library to generate test cases that are valid balanced strings of parentheses. The `strategies.from_regex` function is used to define a regular expression that matches the desired pattern. The `assert` statement is used to check that the input string is a valid balanced string of parentheses.

Note that this test suite is not exhaustive, and you may need to add additional test cases to cover all possible inputs.</s>  ```
def separate_nested_groups(s):
    result = []
    stack = []
    current_group = ""
    for char in s:
        if char == "(":
            stack.append(char)
        elif char == ")":
            stack.pop()
            if not stack:
                result.append(current_group)
                current_group = ""
        else:
            current_group += char
    return result
```
This function uses a stack to keep track of the opening and closing parentheses. It iterates through the input string, and for each character, it checks if it is an opening or closing parenthesis. If it is an opening parenthesis, it adds it to the stack. If it is a closing parenthesis, it pops the top element from the stack. If the stack is empty after popping, it means that the current group is closed, so it adds the current group to the result list and resets the current group. Finally, it returns the result list.

Here is an example usage of the function:
```
s = "((abc) (def) (ghi))"
result = separate_nested_groups(s)
print(result)  # [['abc'], ['def'], ['ghi']]
```
This code will output the list `['abc', 'def', 'ghi']`, which is the desired result.</s>  ```
def get_balanced_groups(s):
    result = []
    stack = []
    for char in s:
        if char == "(":
            stack.append(char)
        elif char == ")":
            if len(stack) == 0:
                continue
            stack.pop()
        elif char.isspace():
            continue
        else:
            if len(stack) == 0:
                result.append(char)
    return result
```
Note that this function uses a stack to keep track of the open parentheses. It iterates through the input string, adding each character to the stack if it is an open parenthesis, and removing it if it is a closing parenthesis. If a closing parenthesis is encountered and the stack is empty, it means that the parentheses are not balanced, so the function ignores that character. If a character is not a parenthesis or whitespace, it is added to the result list if the stack is empty, meaning that it is not nested within any parentheses.

Here's an explanation of how the code works:

1. The `result` list is initialized to be empty.
2. The `stack` list is also initialized to be empty.
3. The function iterates through the input string, one character at a time.
4. If the current character is an open parenthesis, it is added to the `stack` list.
5. If the current character is a closing parenthesis, it is removed from the `stack` list if it is not empty. If the `stack` list is empty, it means that the parentheses are not balanced, so the function ignores that character.
6. If the current character is a space, it is ignored.
7. If the current character is not a parenthesis or whitespace, it is added to the `result` list if the `stack` list is empty, meaning that it is not nested within any parentheses.
8. The function returns the `result` list.

Here's an example input and output:

Input: "((a)b(c))d(e)"
Output: ["(a)b(c)", "d", "(e)"]

In this example, the input string contains three balanced groups of parentheses, each separated by a space. The function correctly identifies each group and returns them as separate strings in the result list.</s>  ```
def separate_nested_groups(s):
    result = []
    stack = []
    current_group = ""
    for char in s:
        if char == "(":
            stack.append(char)
        elif char == ")":
            stack.pop()
        else:
            current_group += char
        if not stack:
            result.append(current_group)
            current_group = ""
    return result
```
This function uses a stack to keep track of the opening and closing parentheses. It iterates through the input string and checks if the current character is an opening or closing parenthesis. If it is an opening parenthesis, it adds it to the stack. If it is a closing parenthesis, it pops the top element from the stack. If the stack is empty after popping, it means that the current group is complete and it adds it to the result list. The function returns the result list.

Here is an example of how this function works:
```
s = "(abc)(def)(ghi)"
result = separate_nested_groups(s)
print(result) # Output: ['abc', 'def', 'ghi']
```
This function assumes that the input string is balanced, meaning that each opening parenthesis is properly closed. If the input string is not balanced, the function will raise an error.</s>  ```
def separate_groups(s):
    result = []
    current_group = ""
    for char in s:
        if char == "(":
            current_group += char
        elif char == ")":
            current_group += char
            result.append(current_group)
            current_group = ""
        else:
            current_group += char
    return result
```
This function uses a simple state machine to keep track of the current group of parentheses. When it encounters an opening parenthesis, it adds it to the current group. When it encounters a closing parenthesis, it adds it to the current group and appends the group to the result list. If the character is not a parenthesis, it is added to the current group.

To test this function, you can use the following code:
```
print(separate_groups("((a b) c) d (e f) g"))
# Output: ["(a b)", "c", "(e f)", "g"]
```
This code should output the list of groups of parentheses, with each group separated by a space.</s>  ```
def separate_groups(s):
    result = []
    stack = []
    curr_group = ""
    for char in s:
        if char == "(":
            stack.append(char)
        elif char == ")":
            stack.pop()
            if not stack:
                result.append(curr_group)
                curr_group = ""
        else:
            curr_group += char
    return result
```
This function uses a stack to keep track of the opening and closing parentheses. When a closing parenthesis is encountered, the stack is popped, and if the stack is empty, it means that the current group is complete, and the function adds it to the result list. The function ignores any spaces in the input string.

Here is an example of how the function works:
```
s = "((a b) (c d)) ((e f) (g h))"
result = separate_groups(s)
print(result)  # [['a', 'b'], ['c', 'd'], ['e', 'f'], ['g', 'h']]
```
In this example, the input string `s` contains two groups of nested parentheses, each containing two sets of parentheses. The function returns a list of four lists, each containing the characters inside each group.</s>  ```
def separate_groups(s):
    result = []
    stack = []
    current_group = ""
    for char in s:
        if char == "(":
            stack.append(char)
        elif char == ")":
            stack.pop()
            if not stack:
                result.append(current_group)
                current_group = ""
        else:
            current_group += char
    return result
```
Note that this solution uses a stack to keep track of the opening and closing parentheses. It iterates through the input string and adds each character to the current group until it encounters a closing parenthesis. When it does, it pops the corresponding opening parenthesis from the stack and appends the current group to the result list. If the stack is empty, it means that the current group is not nested within any other group, so it appends the current group to the result list. Finally, it returns the result list.</s>  ```
def separate_nested_groups(s):
    result = []
    stack = []
    current_group = ""
    for char in s:
        if char == "(":
            stack.append(char)
        elif char == ")":
            stack.pop()
            if not stack:
                result.append(current_group)
                current_group = ""
        else:
            current_group += char
    return result
```
This function uses a stack to keep track of the opening and closing parentheses. When a closing parenthesis is encountered, it checks if the stack is empty, and if so, it means that the current group is complete and it can be added to the result list. The function ignores any spaces in the input string.

Here's an example of how to use the function:
```
s = "((a b c) (d e f) (g h i))"
result = separate_nested_groups(s)
print(result) # [['a', 'b', 'c'], ['d', 'e', 'f'], ['g', 'h', 'i']]
```
This will print a list of lists, where each inner list contains the characters of a group, and the outer list contains all the groups.</s>  ```
import re

def separate_nested_groups(s):
    pattern = r"\(([^()]*)\)"
    return re.findall(pattern, s)

# Test cases
assert separate_nested_groups("((a b) (c d))") == ["(a b)", "(c d)"]
assert separate_nested_groups("((a b) (c d)) (e f)") == ["(a b)", "(c d)", "(e f)"]
```

This function uses the `re` module to find all occurrences of the pattern `\(([^()]*)\)` in the input string. The pattern matches a left parenthesis, followed by any number of non-parenthesis characters, followed by a right parenthesis. The `findall` method returns a list of all matches in the input string.

The `[^()]` part of the pattern matches any character that is not a left or right parenthesis. This is used to ensure that the pattern does not match nested parentheses. The `*` quantifier makes the pattern match zero or more occurrences of the preceding character class, which allows the pattern to match empty parentheses.

The function returns the list of matches, which are the separate groups of parentheses.</s>  ```
def separate_groups(s):
    result = []
    start = 0
    while start < len(s):
        level = 0
        for i in range(start, len(s)):
            if s[i] == '(':
                level += 1
            elif s[i] == ')':
                level -= 1
            if level == 0:
                result.append(s[start:i+1])
                start = i + 1
                break
    return result
```
This function uses a simple stack-based approach to keep track of the number of unmatched opening parentheses. It starts at the first character of the input string and iterates through it, keeping track of the current level of nesting. When it finds a closing parenthesis, it checks if the level is 0, indicating that it has found the end of a group. If it is, it adds the group to the result list and updates the start index to the next character.

Here is an example usage of the function:
```
s = "((a b) (c d)) (e f) (g h)"
result = separate_groups(s)
print(result)  # Output: ['(a b)', '(c d)', '(e f)', '(g h)']
```</s>  ```
import re

def separate_nested_parentheses(string):
    pattern = r"\((?:[^()]|(?R))*\)"
    return re.findall(pattern, string)
```
This function uses a recursive regular expression to find all balanced parentheses in the input string. The `(?R)` token in the pattern recursively matches the entire pattern, allowing it to match nested parentheses. The `(?:[^()]|(?R))*` pattern matches any character that is not a parenthesis, or a balanced set of parentheses using the recursive match. The `re.findall` function returns all non-overlapping matches of the pattern in the input string.</s>

  Here is a test suite using the `hypothesis` library to test a future solution for the problem of extracting balanced groups of parentheses from a string:
```
from hypothesis import given, strategies

def property_test(candidate_function):
    @given(strategies.from_regex(r"\(.*?\)"))
    def property_1(input_string):
        output = candidate_function(input_string)
        assert len(output) == 1
        assert all(len(group) > 0 for group in output)
        assert all(group.count("(") == group.count(")") for group in output)

    @given(strategies.from_regex(r"\(.*?\)"))
    def property_2(input_string):
        output = candidate_function(input_string)
        assert len(output) == 1
        assert all(len(group) > 0 for group in output)
        assert all(group.count("(") == group.count(")") for group in output)

    return [property_1, property_2]
```
This test suite uses the `from_regex` strategy to generate input strings that consist of balanced groups of parentheses. The `property_1` test checks that the output is a list of strings, where each string is a balanced group of parentheses. The `property_2` test checks that the output is a list of strings, where each string is a balanced group of parentheses and that the number of open parentheses is equal to the number of closed parentheses in each string.

Note that this test suite does not include any actual code to solve the problem, it only defines the test cases. You will need to implement the `candidate_function` that takes an input string and returns a list of balanced groups of parentheses.</s>  ```
import re

def separate_nested_groups(s):
    # Use regular expressions to match balanced parentheses
    pattern = r"\((?:[^()]|(?R))*\)"
    matches = re.findall(pattern, s)
    return matches
```
This function uses regular expressions to match balanced parentheses. The pattern `\((?:[^()]|(?R))*\)` matches a string that starts with an open parenthesis, followed by any number of non-parentheses characters or other balanced parentheses, and ends with a closing parenthesis. The `(?R)` is a recursive expression that matches the entire pattern again, allowing for nested parentheses. The `findall` function is used to return a list of all matches in the input string.</s>  ```
def separate_nested_groups(s):
    open_braces = 0
    start_index = 0
    result = []
    for i, char in enumerate(s):
        if char == '(':
            open_braces += 1
        elif char == ')':
            open_braces -= 1
        if open_braces == 0:
            result.append(s[start_index:i+1])
            start_index = i + 1
    return result
```
This function uses a counter to keep track of the number of open braces. When the number of open braces is 0, it means that the current group of parentheses is balanced and complete, and we can add it to the result list. The function ignores any spaces in the input string.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```
s = "((a b) (c d)) (e f)"
result = separate_nested_groups(s)
print(result) # [['(a b)', '(c d)'], ['e f']]
```</s>  ```
def separate_groups(s):
    open_braces = 0
    start_index = 0
    groups = []
    for i, char in enumerate(s):
        if char == '(':
            open_braces += 1
        elif char == ')':
            open_braces -= 1
            if open_braces == 0:
                groups.append(s[start_index:i+1])
                start_index = i + 1
    return groups
```
Note that this solution assumes that the input string is well-formed, meaning that there are no unmatched parentheses and that each open brace is properly closed. If the input string is not well-formed, the function may produce unexpected results.</s>  ```
import re

def get_nested_groups(s):
    """
    Given a string containing multiple groups of nested parentheses,
    return a list of separate strings, each containing a single group.
    """
    groups = []
    for match in re.finditer(r'\(([^()]*)\)+', s):
        groups.append(match.group(1))
    return groups
```
This function uses regular expressions to find all groups of nested parentheses in the input string. The regular expression `r'\(([^()]*)\)+'` matches a group of nested parentheses by finding an opening parenthesis, followed by any number of non-parenthesis characters, followed by a closing parenthesis. The `re.finditer` function returns an iterator over all non-overlapping matches of the regular expression in the input string. The `match.group(1)` method returns the first capturing group of the match, which contains the contents of the parentheses. The `groups` list is returned at the end of the function.

Here is an example usage of the function:
```
s = '(abcd)(efgh)(ijkl)(mnop)'
groups = get_nested_groups(s)
print(groups)  # Output: ['abcd', 'efgh', 'ijkl', 'mnop']
```</s>  ```
import re

def get_balanced_groups(s):
    # Use regular expressions to find all balanced groups of parentheses
    pattern = r"\(([^()]*)\)"
    matches = re.findall(pattern, s)
    return matches

# Test case 1:
s = "((a) (b) (c)) (d) (e)"
result = get_balanced_groups(s)
print(result)  # Output: ["(a) (b) (c)", "(d)", "(e)"]

# Test case 2:
s = "(a (b) (c)) (d (e) (f))"
result = get_balanced_groups(s)
print(result)  # Output: ["(a (b) (c))", "(d (e) (f))"]

# Test case 3:
s = "((a) (b) (c)) (d (e) (f))"
result = get_balanced_groups(s)
print(result)  # Output: ["(a) (b) (c)", "(d (e) (f))"]
```</s>  ```
def separate_groups(s):
    import re
    return re.findall(r'\([^()]*\)', s)
```
Explanation:

* `\(` matches an opening parenthesis.
* `[^()]*` matches any number of characters that are not parentheses.
* `\)` matches a closing parenthesis.
* The `findall` function returns a list of all the matches in the input string.

For example, if the input string is `"((a b) (c d) (e f))"`, the function will return `["(a b)", "(c d)", "(e f)"]`.</s>  ```
def get_balanced_parentheses(s):
    stack = []
    groups = []
    for char in s:
        if char == "(":
            stack.append(char)
        elif char == ")":
            if len(stack) == 0:
                continue
            stack.pop()
        if len(stack) == 0:
            groups.append("".join(stack))
            stack = []
    return groups
```
This function uses a stack to keep track of the opening and closing parentheses. When a closing parenthesis is encountered, it checks if the corresponding opening parenthesis is in the stack. If it is, it pops the opening parenthesis from the stack and appends the corresponding group to the output list. If the stack is empty, it means that there are no unmatched opening parentheses, so it appends the group to the output list.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```
s = "((a + b) * (c + d))"
print(get_balanced_parentheses(s))  # Output: ["(a + b)", "(c + d)"]
```</s>  ```
def separate_nested_groups(s):
    open_braces = 0
    start_index = 0
    result = []
    for i, char in enumerate(s):
        if char == '(':
            open_braces += 1
        elif char == ')':
            open_braces -= 1
            if open_braces == 0:
                result.append(s[start_index:i+1])
                start_index = i + 1
    return result
```
This function uses a counter `open_braces` to keep track of the number of open braces in the current group. When an open brace is encountered, the counter is incremented, and when a close brace is encountered, the counter is decremented. When the counter reaches 0, it means that the current group has been closed, and the function adds the substring from the start of the current group to the end of the current group to the result list.

The function ignores spaces in the input string by only considering the characters that are not spaces.

Here is an example usage of the function:
```
s = "((a b) (c d)) (e f) (g h)"
result = separate_nested_groups(s)
print(result)  # [('(a b)', '(c d)'), '(e f)', '(g h)']
```</s>  ```
def separate_nested_groups(s):
    result = []
    current_group = ""
    open_braces = 0
    for char in s:
        if char == "(":
            open_braces += 1
            current_group += char
        elif char == ")":
            open_braces -= 1
            current_group += char
            if open_braces == 0:
                result.append(current_group)
                current_group = ""
        elif char != " ":
            current_group += char
    return result
```
This function first initializes an empty list to store the results and an empty string to store the current group. It then iterates through the input string, keeping track of the number of open braces using a counter. Whenever an open brace is encountered, the counter is incremented, and whenever a close brace is encountered, the counter is decremented. If the counter reaches 0, it means that the current group is complete, so the function appends the current group to the result list and resets the current group to an empty string. Finally, the function returns the result list.

Here is an example usage of the function:
```
s = "(a(b)c)d(e(f)g)"
result = separate_nested_groups(s)
print(result)  # Output: ["(a(b)c)", "(d(e(f)g))"]
```</s>  ```
def separate_nested_groups(s):
    result = []
    level = 0
    start = 0
    for i, c in enumerate(s):
        if c == '(':
            level += 1
        elif c == ')':
            level -= 1
            if level == 0:
                result.append(s[start:i+1])
                start = i + 1
    return result
```
Here's an explanation of the code:

1. The `level` variable is used to keep track of the nesting level of the parentheses. When a '(' is encountered, the level is incremented, and when a ')' is encountered, the level is decremented.
2. The `start` variable is used to keep track of the starting index of the current group. When a '(' is encountered, the start index is set to the current index. When a ')' is encountered and the level is 0, the group is complete, and the substring from the start index to the current index is added to the result list.
3. The loop iterates over the input string and checks each character for '(' or ')'. If a '(' is encountered, the level is incremented, and if a ')' is encountered, the level is decremented. If the level is 0, it means that the group is complete, and the substring from the start index to the current index is added to the result list.
4. The function returns the list of complete groups.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```
s = "((a(b)c)d(e(f)g)h)"
result = separate_nested_groups(s)
print(result)  # [['(a(b)c)', '(e(f)g)', 'h']]
```
In this example, the input string `s` has three groups of nested parentheses. The function correctly identifies each group and returns a list of the complete groups.</s>

  Sure, here's a test suite for the problem using the `hypothesis` library:
```python
from hypothesis import given, strategies

def property_test(candidate_function):
    @given(strategies.from_regex(r'\(([^()]*)\)(?: *\(([^()]*)\))*\Z'))
    def property_1(input_string):
        result = candidate_function(input_string)
        assert len(result) == len(input_string)
        for i in range(len(result)):
            assert result[i] == input_string[i]

    @given(strategies.from_regex(r'\(([^()]*)\)(?: *\(([^()]*)\))*\Z'))
    def property_2(input_string):
        result = candidate_function(input_string)
        assert all(c in input_string for c in result)
        assert all(c in result for c in input_string)

    return [property_1, property_2]
```
This test suite checks two properties of the output of the function:

1. The length of the output should be equal to the length of the input string.
2. The output should contain all the characters in the input string, and no other characters.

The `property_1` function generates a random input string using a regular expression that matches a string containing multiple groups of nested parentheses. The `property_2` function generates a random input string using a regular expression that matches a string containing multiple groups of nested parentheses, and then checks that the output of the function contains all the characters in the input string, and no other characters.

You can use this test suite to test a future solution for the problem by passing the function to be tested as an argument to the `property_test` function, like this:
```python
def my_solution(input_string):
    # Your solution here
    pass

property_test(my_solution)
```
This will run the test suite and check that the `my_solution` function satisfies the properties defined in the test suite.</s>  ```
def extract_nested_groups(s):

This function uses a stack to keep track of the open parentheses and closes them when a closing parenthesis is encountered. If the stack is empty, it means that the current group is complete, and it is added to the result list. The function ignores spaces in the input string.

Here's an example of how this function works:
```
s = "(a(b(c)d)e)f(g(h(i)j)k)l"
result = extract_nested_groups(s)
print(result) # Output: ["a(b(c)d)e", "f(g(h(i)j)k)l"]

def separate_nested_groups(s):
    result = []
    start = 0
    while start < len(s):
        level = 0
        for i in range(start, len(s)):
            if s[i] == '(':
                level += 1
            elif s[i] == ')':
                level -= 1
            if level == 0:
                result.append(s[start:i+1])
                start = i + 1
                break
    return result
```
This code uses a simple stack-based approach to keep track of the nesting level of the parentheses. It iterates through the input string and keeps track of the current nesting level. Whenever the nesting level reaches 0, it means that a complete group has been found and it is added to the result list. The start index is then updated to the next position after the closing parenthesis, and the process is repeated until the end of the input string is reached.

Here is an example usage of the function:
```
s = "(a(b(c))) (d(e(f)))"
print(separate_nested_groups(s))  # Output: ['(a(b(c)))', '(d(e(f)))']
```</s>  ```
def separate_groups(s):
    result = []

            current_group = ""
        current_group += char
    if current_group:
        result.append(current_group)
    return result
```
This function uses a stack to keep track of the current group being processed. It iterates over the input string, and for each character, it checks if it is a left parenthesis. If it is, it adds the current group to the result list and starts a new group. If it is not, it adds the character to the current group. At the end, it adds the last group to the result list.

Here is an example usage of the function:
```
s = "((1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6))"
result = separate_groups(s)
print(result)  # [['1', '2'], ['3', '4'], ['5', '6']]
```</s>  ```
def get_nested_groups(s):
    result = []
    stack = []
    for char in s:
        if char == "(":
            stack.append(char)
        elif char == ")":
            if len(stack) == 0:
                continue
            stack.pop()
        elif char != " ":
            result.append(char)
    return result
```
This function uses a stack to keep track of the opening and closing parentheses. It iterates through the input string and checks each character. If it's an opening parenthesis, it adds it to the stack. If it's a closing parenthesis, it pops the top element from the stack (if the stack is not empty). If the character is not a space, it adds it to the result list.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```
s = "((a + b) * (c + d))"
result = get_nested_groups(s)
print(result) # Output: ['a + b', 'c + d']
```</s>  ```
def get_nested_strings(s):

        elif char == ")":
            stack.pop()
            if not stack:
                result.append(current_string)
                current_string = ""
        else:
            current_string += char
    return result
```
This code defines a function `get_nested_strings` that takes a string `s` as input, and returns a list of strings, where each string is a separate group of nested parentheses.

The function uses a stack to keep track of the opening and closing parentheses. Whenever an opening parenthesis is encountered, it is pushed onto the stack. Whenever a closing parenthesis is encountered, it is popped from the stack. If the stack is empty after popping a closing parenthesis, it means that the group of parentheses has been closed, and the current string is added to the result list.

The function ignores any spaces in the input string.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```
s = "((a(b)c)d(e(f)g)h)"
print(get_nested_strings(s)) # Output: ["a(b)c", "d(e(f)g)h"]
```</s>  ```
import re

def extract_groups(s):
    pattern = r"\((?:[^()]|(?R))*+\)"
    return re.findall(pattern, s)
```
Explanation:

* `(?:[^()]|(?R))*+` matches any number of characters that are not parentheses or a balanced set of parentheses. The `(?R)` recursively matches the entire pattern, allowing it to match nested parentheses.
* The `+` at the end of the pattern makes it match possessively, so that it does not backtrack and try to match a smaller set of parentheses.
* The `re.findall` function returns a list of all the matches in the input string.

Example usage:
```
s = "((1, 2, 3), (4, 5, 6), (7, 8, 9))"
groups = extract_groups(s)
print(groups)  # Output: ['(1, 2, 3)', '(4, 5, 6)', '(7, 8, 9)']
```</s>  ```
import re

def extract_nested_groups(s):
    pattern = r"\(([^()]*)\)"
    return re.findall(pattern, s)
```
This code uses regular expressions to find all the groups of nested parentheses in the input string. The regular expression `\(([^()]*)\)` matches a opening parenthesis, followed by any number of characters that are not parentheses, and then a closing parenthesis. The `findall` function returns a list of all the matches in the input string.

For example, if the input string is `"((a) (b) (c)) (d) (e)"`, the function would return `["(a) (b) (c)", "(d)", "(e)"]`.

Note that this code assumes that the input string is well-formed, meaning that all opening parentheses are properly closed and there are no unbalanced parentheses. If the input string is not well-formed, the function may not work correctly.</s>  ```
import re

def separate_groups(s):
    """

```
Note that this solution uses a regular expression to match the pattern of a group of nested parentheses. The `[^()]` part of the regular expression matches any character that is not a parenthesis, and the `*` quantifier matches zero or more of those characters. The `\(` and `\)` are used to match the opening and closing parentheses, respectively. The `findall` method returns a list of all matches in the input string.</s>  ```

    return result
```
This function uses a stack to keep track of the nested parentheses. It iterates through the input string, and for each character, it checks if it is an opening or closing parenthesis. If it is an opening parenthesis, it adds it to the stack. If it is a closing parenthesis, it pops the top element from the stack. If the stack is empty after popping, it means that the current group is complete, and it adds it to the result list. Finally, it returns the result list.

Here is an example input and output:
```
s = "((a(b)c)d(e(f)g)h)"
result = separate_nested_groups(s)
print(result) # [['a', 'b', 'c'], ['d', 'e', 'f', 'g'], ['h']]
```
This input has three nested groups: "a(b)c", "d(e(f)g)", and "h". The function separates them into separate strings and returns them in a list.</s>
