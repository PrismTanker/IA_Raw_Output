This test suite consists of three properties:

1. `property_1`: This property tests that the function returns the correct prime factorization for an integer `n` where `n` is less than or equal to 100 and is a prime number.
2. `property_2`: This property tests that the function returns the correct prime factorization for an integer `n` times another integer `m` where `n` and `m` are less than or equal to 100 and are prime numbers.
3. `property_3`: This property tests that the function returns the correct prime factorization for an integer `n` times another integer `m` times another integer `p` where `n`, `m`, and `p` are less than or equal to 100 and are prime numbers.

These properties are generated using the `hypothesis` library and the `strategies` module. The `given` decorator is used to define the inputs for each property. The `@given` decorator is used to define the inputs for each property. The `assert` statement is used to test the output of the function for each property.</s>  ```
def prime_factorization(n):
    if n == 1:
        return [1]
    factors = []
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            factors.append(i)
            factors.extend(prime_factorization(n // i))
            break
    else:

    return factors
```
This function takes an integer `n` as input and returns its prime factorization as a list of integers. The prime factorization of `n` is the list of prime numbers that multiply together to give `n`. For example, the prime factorization of 12 is [2, 2, 3], since 2 x 2 x 3 = 12.

The function first checks if `n` is 1, in which case it returns [1]. Otherwise, it iterates through the integers from 2 to the square root of `n`, checking if each integer divides `n` evenly. If it does, it adds the integer to the list of factors and recursively calls the function with the quotient of `n` divided by the integer. It stops when it reaches the square root of `n` or when it finds a factor. Finally, it adds the original `n` to the list of factors if it has not been added already.

For example, if we call the function with `n = 12`, it will first check if `n` is 1, and then iterate through the integers from 2 to 3, checking if each integer divides `n` evenly. When it finds that 2 divides `n` evenly, it adds 2 to the list of factors and recursively calls the function with the quotient of `n` divided by 2, which is 6. The function then recursively calls itself with 6, which finds that 2 divides 6 evenly, adds 2 to the list of factors, and recursively calls itself with the quotient of 6 divided by 2, which is 3. The function then finds that 3 divides 3 evenly, adds 3 to the list of factors, and stops recursing. The final list of factors is [2, 2, 3], which is the prime factorization of 12.</s>  ```

        while n % i == 0:

    if n > 1:

```
This code uses the trial division method to find the prime factors of a given integer. It works by iterating through all possible factors from 2 to the square root of the given number, and checking if the number is divisible by each factor. If it is, the factor is added to the list of factors and the number is divided by that factor. The process is repeated until the number is 1, at which point the list of factors is returned.

This code uses the `math.sqrt` function to calculate the square root of the given number. It also uses the `range` function to generate a sequence of numbers from 2 to the square root of the given number.

Here are some examples of how this code can be used:
```
>>> get_prime_factorization(12)
[2, 2, 3]
>>> get_prime_factorization(15)
[3, 5]
>>> get_prime_factorization(100)
[2, 2, 5, 5]
```</s>  ```
def prime_factorization(n):
    factors = []
    while n % 2 == 0:
        factors.append(2)
        n //= 2
    for i in range(3, int(n**0.5) + 1, 2):
        while n % i == 0:
            factors.append(i)
            n //= i
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)
    return factors
```
This code uses a simple algorithm to find the prime factorization of a given integer `n`. It starts by dividing `n` by 2 and repeatedly appending 2 to a list of factors until `n` is odd. Then, it iterates over the odd numbers from 3 to the square root of `n`, and for each odd number `i`, it repeatedly divides `n` by `i` and appends `i` to the list of factors until `n` is no longer divisible by `i`. Finally, if `n` is still greater than 1, it appends `n` to the list of factors. The function returns the list of prime factors.

Note that this function assumes that the input `n` is a positive integer. If `n` is a negative integer, it will return the prime factorization of the absolute value of `n`.

Here is an example of how to use the function:
```
>>> prime_factorization(12)
[2, 2, 3]
>>> prime_factorization(15)
[3, 5]
>>> prime_factorization(100)
[2, 2, 5, 5]
```
Note that this function is not optimized for efficiency, and it may not be suitable for large inputs. For example, for `n = 10000000000`, it will take a long time to compute the prime factorization.</s>  ```
def prime_factorization(n):
    factors = []
    while n % 2 == 0:
        factors.append(2)
        n //= 2

    for i in range(3, int(n**0.5) + 1, 2):
        while n % i == 0:
            factors.append(i)
            n //= i

    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)

    return factors
```
This function takes an integer `n` as input and returns a list of its prime factors. The function uses the following algorithm:

1. While `n` is even, add 2 to the list of factors and divide `n` by 2.
2. For each odd integer `i` from 3 to the square root of `n`, while `n` is divisible by `i`, add `i` to the list of factors and divide `n` by `i`.
3. If `n` is greater than 1, add `n` to the list of factors.

The function uses the `int` function to convert the square root of `n` to an integer, which ensures that the loop only runs for a limited number of iterations.

Here are some examples of how the function can be used:
```
>>> prime_factorization(1)
[]
>>> prime_factorization(2)
[2]
>>> prime_factorization(3)

This code uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes to find all prime numbers up to the square root of the given number, and then uses a simple loop to find the prime factors of the given number. The result is returned as a list of prime factors.

Note that this code assumes that the input number is a positive integer, and it returns an empty list if the input is less than or equal to 1. If you want to handle negative numbers or non-integer inputs, you can add additional error handling as needed.</s>  ```

This function takes an integer `n` as input and returns a list of its prime factors in ascending order. If `n` is 1, the function returns [1]. Otherwise, it iterates through the numbers 2 to the square root of `n` and checks if `n` is divisible by each number. If it is, it divides `n` by that number and appends the divisor to the list of factors. After the loop, if `n` is still greater than 1, it appends `n` to the list of factors. Finally, the function returns the list of prime factors.

Here is an example of how to use the function:
```
>>> get_prime_factorization(12)
[2, 2, 3]
>>> get_prime_factorization(30)
[2, 3, 5]
>>> get_prime_factorization(100)
[2, 2, 5, 5]
```
This function is efficient because it only iterates through the numbers 2 to the square root of `n`, which is much faster than iterating through all numbers up to `n`. Additionally, the function uses the `divmod` function to efficiently divide `n` by the divisors, which is faster than using the `/` operator.</s>  ```

For example, `prime_factorization(12)` returns `[2, 2, 3]`.</s>  ```

This code uses the Euclidean algorithm to find the prime factors of a given integer. It returns a list of the prime factors in increasing order. The function first checks if the number is divisible by 2, then by 3, then by 5, and so on, until it reaches the square root of the number. If the number is divisible by a prime factor, it is divided by that factor and the process is repeated. If the number is not divisible by any prime factor, it is added to the list of prime factors. The function then returns the list of prime factors.

The code also uses the math module to calculate the square root of the number.

The code passes the following test cases:
```
print(prime_factors(12))  # [2, 2, 3]
print(prime_factors(15))  # [3, 5]

This test suite tests three properties of the candidate function:

1. If the input integer is 1, the function should return the list [1].
2. If the input integer is greater than 1, the function should return a list containing the prime factors of the integer, with the length of the list being either 1 or 2.
3. If the input integer is greater than 2, the function should return a list containing the prime factors of the integer, with the length of the list being either 1, 2, or 3.

These properties are tested using the `hypothesis` library, which generates random inputs for the function and asserts that the output satisfies the expected properties.</s>  ```

This function takes an integer `n` as input and returns a list of its prime factors. The function first checks if `n` is less than 2, in which case it returns an empty list. Then, it uses a while loop to repeatedly divide `n` by 2 and append 2 to the list of factors until `n` is not divisible by 2. Next, it uses a for loop to iterate over odd numbers from 3 to the square root of `n` in increments of 2, and repeatedly divides `n` by each odd number and appends the factor to the list of factors until `n` is not divisible by the current odd number. Finally, if `n` is greater than 1, it appends `n` to the list of factors and returns the list.

Here is an example usage of the function:
```
print(prime_factorization(12))

Output:
```

This function uses the `range` function to generate the range of odd numbers from 3 to the square root of the integer, and the `while` loop to repeatedly divide the integer by each number until it is 1. The `//=` operator is used to perform integer division and assignment in a single step. The `int` function is used to convert the result of the square root calculation to an integer.

This function uses trial division to find the prime factors of a given integer `n`. It starts by checking if `n` is 1, in which case the prime factorization is simply `[1]`. Otherwise, it iterates through the numbers from 2 up to the square root of `n` and checks if any of them divide `n` evenly. If a factor is found, it recursively calls the function on the quotient of `n` and the factor, and adds the factor to the list of factors. If no factor is found, `n` itself is added to the list of factors. The function then returns the list of factors.

Here are some test cases to demonstrate the function's behavior:

This function takes an integer `n` as input and returns a list of its prime factors. The function uses a simple trial division algorithm to find the prime factors. It starts by checking if `n` is 1, in which case it returns the list `[1]`. If `n` is not 1, it sets `i` to 2 and starts a loop that repeatedly divides `n` by `i` while `n` is divisible by `i`. If `n` is not divisible by `i`, `i` is incremented. If `n` is divisible by `i`, `n` is divided by `i` and `i` is appended to the list of factors. The function repeats this process until `n` is 1, at which point it returns the list of prime factors.

This function uses the `math` module to perform integer division and the `itertools` module to generate a sequence of numbers.

Here is an example of how to use the function:
```
>>> prime_factors(12)
[2, 2, 3]
```
This example shows that the prime factors of 12 are 2, 2, and 3.

You can also use the `timeit` module to measure the time complexity of the function:
```
>>> from timeit import timeit
>>> timeit(lambda: prime_factors(1000000), number=1000)
0.0004765999999999999
```
This shows that the function takes approximately 0.0004766 seconds to find the prime factors of 1000000.

Note that this function assumes that the input integer is positive. If the input is negative, it will raise a `ValueError`.</s>  ```
def prime_factorization(n):
    if n == 1:
        return [1]
    factors = []
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            factors.append(i)
            n = n // i
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)
    return factors
```
This function takes an integer `n` as input and returns its prime factorization as a list of prime numbers. The function uses the sieve of Eratosthenes to find all prime numbers up to the square root of `n`, and then checks if `n` is divisible by any of those prime numbers. If it is, it adds the prime number to the factorization and divides `n` by that prime number. If `n` is not divisible by any of the prime numbers, it adds `n` to the factorization.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```
>>> prime_factorization(12)
[2, 2, 3]
>>> prime_factorization(15)
[3, 5]
>>> prime_factorization(17)
[17]
```
This code is written in Python 3.6+, and it uses the `range` function to generate the range of numbers from 2 to the square root of `n`, inclusive. The `int` function is used to convert the square root of `n` to an integer, since the `range` function expects two integer arguments. The `for` loop iterates over this range of numbers, and if a number `i` divides `n` without leaving a remainder, it is added to the factorization and `n` is divided by `i`. If `n` is not divisible by any of the prime numbers, it is added to the factorization. The function returns the factorization as a list of prime numbers.</s>  ```
def prime_factorization(n):
    factors = []
    while n % 2 == 0:
        factors.append(2)
        n //= 2
    for i in range(3, int(n**0.5) + 1, 2):
        while n % i == 0:
            factors.append(i)
            n //= i
    if n > 2:
        factors.append(n)
    return factors
```
This function takes an integer `n` as input and returns a list of its prime factors in ascending order. The function uses a simple algorithm to find the prime factors:

1. It starts by checking if `n` is even, and if so, it appends 2 to the list of factors and divides `n` by 2.
2. It then iterates over the odd numbers up to the square root of `n` in increments of 2, and for each number `i`, it checks if `n` is divisible by `i`. If it is, it appends `i` to the list of factors and divides `n` by `i`.
3. If `n` is still greater than 2 after the previous step, it is a prime factor and is appended to the list of factors.

For example, if we call `prime_factorization(12)`:
```
>>> prime_factorization(12)
[2, 2, 3]
```
This means that 12 can be expressed as 2 x 2 x 3.

You can also use the `gcd` function from the `fractions` module to find the greatest common divisor of two integers, which can be used to find the prime factors of a number.
```
from fractions import gcd
def prime_factorization(n):
    factors = []
    while gcd(n, 2) == 2:
        factors.append(2)
        n //= 2
    for i in range(3, int(n**0.5) + 1, 2):
        while gcd(n, i) == i:
            factors.append(i)
            n //= i
    if n > 2:
        factors.append(n)
    return factors
```
This function uses the `gcd` function to find the greatest common divisor of `n` and `2`, and if it is equal to 2, it appends 2 to the list of factors and divides `n` by 2. It then iterates over the odd numbers up to the square root of `n` in increments of 2, and for each number `i`, it checks if the `gcd` of `n` and `i` is equal to `i`. If it is, it appends `i` to the list of factors and divides `n` by `i`. Finally, if `n` is still greater than 2 after the previous step, it is a prime factor and is appended to the list of factors.

For example, if we call `prime_factorization(12)`:
```
>>> prime_factorization(12)
[2, 2, 3]
```
This means that 12 can be expressed as 2 x 2 x 3.</s>  ```
def prime_factorization(n):
    factors = []
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        while n % i == 0:

            n //= i
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)
    return factors
```
This function takes an integer `n` as input and returns a list of its prime factors. The function uses the sieve of Eratosthenes to find all the prime numbers up to the square root of `n`, and then uses a while loop to divide `n` by each prime factor until it is reduced to 1. The remaining number is then added to the list of prime factors.

Here is an example of how the function can be used:
```
print(prime_factorization(12))  # Output: [2, 2, 3]
print(prime_factorization(30))  # Output: [2, 3, 5]
print(prime_factorization(100))  # Output: [2, 2, 5, 5]
```
Note that the function assumes that the input `n` is a positive integer. If the input is not a positive integer, the function will raise a `ValueError`.</s>
