Prompt: Return area for a triangle based on two side lengths.
-------------------
  Here is a test suite in the format you specified:
```
{
    "test_triangle_area_1": {
        "in": {
            "base": 3,
            "height": 4
        },
        "out": 6
    },
    "test_triangle_area_2": {
        "in": {
            "base": 5,
            "height": 6
        },
        "out": 15
    },
    "test_triangle_area_3": {
        "in": {
            "base": 7,
            "height": 8
        },
        "out": 28
    }
}
```
This test suite includes three test cases, each with a different set of input parameters and the expected output. The input parameters are `base` and `height`, and the output is the area of the triangle.</s>  ```
def triangle_area(side_a: float, side_b: float) -> float:
    """
    Calculates the area of a triangle given two side lengths.

    Args:
        side_a: The length of one side of the triangle.
        side_b: The length of the other side of the triangle.

    Returns:
        The area of the triangle.
    """
    return (side_a * side_b) / 2
```</s>  ```
def triangle_area(side1, side2):
    return (side1 * side2) / 2
```

This code defines a function `triangle_area` that takes two arguments `side1` and `side2`, which are the lengths of two sides of a triangle. The function returns the area of the triangle, which is calculated by multiplying the two side lengths and dividing by 2.

Here's an example of how you can use this function:
```
print(triangle_area(3, 4))  # Output: 6.0
```
This will print the area of a triangle with sides of length 3 and 4, which is 6.0.</s>  ```
def triangle_area(side1, side2):
    return (side1 * side2) / 2
```
This function takes two arguments `side1` and `side2` which are the lengths of the sides of a triangle, and returns the area of the triangle.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```
print(triangle_area(3, 4)) # Output: 6.0
```
Note that the function uses the formula for the area of a triangle, which is `A = (base * height) / 2`, where `base` is the length of one side and `height` is the length of the perpendicular side.</s>  ```
import math

def triangle_area(base, height):
    return 0.5 * base * height
```</s>  ```
def triangle_area(side_a, side_b):
    return (side_a * side_b) / 2
```

Here's an explanation of the code:

* The function takes two arguments, `side_a` and `side_b`, which are the lengths of two sides of a triangle.
* The function returns the area of the triangle using the formula: `area = (side_a * side_b) / 2`.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```
print(triangle_area(3, 4)) # Output: 6.0
```
This prints the area of a triangle with sides of length 3 and 4, which is 6.0.</s>  ```
def triangle_area(base, height):
    return base * height / 2
```

This function takes in two parameters: `base` and `height`, which are the base and height of the triangle, respectively. It returns the area of the triangle using the formula `base * height / 2`.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```
print(triangle_area(5, 6)) # Output: 15.0
```
This will output 15.0, which is the area of the triangle with a base of 5 and a height of 6.</s>  ```
def triangle_area(base, height):
    return (base * height) / 2
```
This code defines a function called `triangle_area` that takes two arguments, `base` and `height`, and returns the area of a triangle with those dimensions. The formula used to calculate the area is (base * height) / 2.

Here's an example of how to use this function:
```
print(triangle_area(5, 6)) # Output: 15.0
```
This would calculate the area of a triangle with a base of 5 units and a height of 6 units, which would be 15 square units.</s>  ```
def triangle_area(side1, side2):
    return (side1 * side2) / 2
```</s>  ```
def triangle_area(base, height):
    return (base * height) / 2
```

This function takes in two arguments: `base` and `height`, which are the lengths of the base and height of the triangle, respectively. It returns the area of the triangle, which is calculated by multiplying the base and height and dividing the result by 2.

Here's an example of how you can use this function:
```
print(triangle_area(5, 6))  # Output: 15.0
```
This code will calculate the area of a triangle with a base of 5 units and a height of 6 units, and print the result to the console.</s>  ```
def triangle_area(base, height):
    return (base * height) / 2
```

This function takes two arguments, `base` and `height`, which are the base and height of the triangle, respectively. It returns the area of the triangle, which is calculated as half the product of the base and height.</s>
