import numpy as np

def monotonic(my_list):
    return np.all(np.diff(my_list) > 0) or np.all(np.diff(my_list) < 0)
```

This function uses the `numpy` module to calculate the difference between consecutive elements in the list using the `diff` function. It then checks if all of these differences are greater than 0 or if all of them are less than 0. If this is the case, the list is monotonically increasing or decreasing, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

Note that this function assumes that the list is at least two elements long, as it is not possible for a list with only one element to be monotonically increasing or decreasing.</s>  ```
import itertools

def monotonic(my_list):
    return all(my_list[i] <= my_list[i+1] for i in range(len(my_list)-1))
```
This code uses the `itertools` module to iterate over the list and compare each element with the next element. The `all` function is used to ensure that all the elements in the list are monotonically increasing or decreasing. The `range` function is used to iterate over the list without including the last element, which is not needed for the comparison.

The `monotonic` function returns `True` if all the elements in the list are monotonically increasing or decreasing, and `False` otherwise.

Note that this function assumes that the list is not empty. If the list is empty, the function will return `False`.

Also note that this function only checks for monotonicity in the forward direction (i.e., from left to right). If you want to check for monotonicity in both directions (i.e., from left to right and from right to left), you can use the following modified version of the function:
```
import itertools

def monotonic(my_list):
    return all(my_list[i] <= my_list[i+1] for i in range(len(my_list)-1)) and all(my_list[i] >= my_list[i-1] for i in range(len(my_list)-1))
```
This function uses the same logic as the previous function, but it also checks for monotonicity in the reverse direction by using the `all` function to iterate over the list in reverse order.</s>  ```
def monotonic(arr):
    if len(arr) <= 1:
        return True
    else:
        diff = arr[1] - arr[0]
        for i in range(2, len(arr)):
            if (arr[i] - arr[i-1]) * diff < 0:
                return False
        return True
```</s>  ```
def monotonic(my_list):
    return all(my_list[i] <= my_list[i+1] for i in range(len(my_list)-1))
```
This code uses the `all()` function to check if all the elements of the list are monotonically increasing or decreasing. The `range()` function is used to iterate over the list, and the `i+1` index is used to compare the current element with the next element in the list. The `all()` function returns `True` if all the elements in the list satisfy the condition, and `False` otherwise.

Note that this code assumes that the list is not empty. If the list can be empty, you can add a check for that before using the `all()` function.

Also, this code assumes that the list elements are of the same type. If the list elements are of different types, you may need to modify the code to handle that case.</s>  ```
import numpy as np

def monotonic(arr):
    return np.all(np.diff(arr) >= 0) or np.all(np.diff(arr) <= 0)
```

This code uses the `numpy` module to calculate the difference between consecutive elements of the list. The `np.diff` function returns the differences between the elements, and then `np.all` is used to check if all the differences are non-negative or all the differences are non-positive. If this is the case, then the list is monotonically increasing or decreasing.

Note that this code assumes that the list has at least two elements. If the list has only one element, it will return `True` because the difference between the only two elements is 0, which is both positive and negative. If you want to handle lists with only one element, you can modify the code to check if the length of the list is greater than 1 before performing the calculation.</s>  ```
def monotonic(my_list):
    return all(my_list[i] <= my_list[i+1] for i in range(len(my_list)-1))
```
This code uses the `all()` function to check that all adjacent elements in the list are either increasing or decreasing. The `range(len(my_list)-1)` creates a range of indices for the list, excluding the last element. The `my_list[i] <= my_list[i+1]` checks that the current element is less than or equal to the next element, which ensures that the list is monotonically increasing or decreasing. If the list is not monotonically increasing or decreasing, the `all()` function will return `False`.</s>  ```
def monotonic(lst):
    return all(lst[i] <= lst[i + 1] for i in range(len(lst) - 1))
```
This code uses the `all()` function to check if all elements in the list are monotonically increasing or decreasing. The `range(len(lst) - 1)` part is used to iterate over the indices of the list, excluding the last element. The `lst[i] <= lst[i + 1]` part checks if the current element is less than or equal to the next element in the list. If this condition is true for all elements in the list, then the list is monotonically increasing or decreasing.

Note: This code assumes that the list has at least two elements. If the list has only one element, the condition `len(lst) - 1` will fail, and the function will return `False`.</s>  ```
import itertools

def monotonic(arr):
    return all(x <= y for x, y in itertools.pairwise(arr)) or all(x >= y for x, y in itertools.pairwise(arr))
```

This code uses the `pairwise` function from the `itertools` module to iterate over the pairs of elements in the list. It then checks if all the elements in the list are either monotonically increasing or decreasing using the `all` function. If the list is not monotonically increasing or decreasing, the function returns `False`, otherwise it returns `True`.</s>  ```
def monotonic(arr):
    if len(arr) <= 1:
        return True
    direction = arr[1] - arr[0]
    for i in range(2, len(arr)):
        if (arr[i] - arr[i-1]) * direction < 0:
            return False
    return True
```
This code defines a function `monotonic` that takes a list of integers as an argument and returns `True` if the list is monotonically increasing or decreasing, and `False` otherwise. The function uses the following approach:

1. If the length of the list is less than or equal to 1, it returns `True`.
2. It calculates the direction of the list by subtracting the first element from the second element.
3. It iterates over the rest of the list and checks if the difference between each element and the previous element is positive and in the same direction as the initial direction. If the direction changes, it returns `False`.
4. If the list is monotonically increasing or decreasing, the function returns `True`.

This function passes the given test cases:
```
>>> monotonic([1, 2, 4, 20])
True
>>> monotonic([1, 20, 4, 10])
False
>>> monotonic([4, 1, 0, -10])
True
```</s>  ```
import numpy as np

def monotonic(arr):
    return np.all(np.diff(arr) > 0) or np.all(np.diff(arr) < 0)
```
This code uses the `numpy` library to calculate the differences between adjacent elements of the list and check if all the differences are either positive or negative. If this condition is satisfied, the list is considered monotonically increasing or decreasing. The `np.all()` function is used to check if all the elements of the array meet the condition, and the `np.diff()` function is used to calculate the differences between adjacent elements.</s>

This code uses the `math.isclose()` function to check if two numbers are close to each other within a certain tolerance. The `all()` function is used to check if all the elements in the `diff` list are either equal to the first element or zero. If the list is monotonically increasing or decreasing, then all the differences between consecutive elements will be either equal to the first difference or zero.

def monotonic(my_list):
    return all(my_list[i] <= my_list[i+1] for i in range(len(my_list)-1))
```
This code uses the `all()` function to check that every element in the list is less than or equal to the next element. The `range(len(my_list)-1)` specifies that the function should only check adjacent elements. If all elements are monotonically increasing or decreasing, the `all()` function will return `True`, otherwise it will return `False`.

Note that this function assumes that the list is already sorted. If the list is not sorted, you will need to sort it before passing it to this function. You can use the `sorted()` function for this purpose.</s>  ```
import numpy as np

def monotonic(my_list):
    return np.all(np.diff(my_list) > 0) or np.all(np.diff(my_list) < 0)
```
This code uses the `numpy.diff` function to calculate the difference between adjacent elements in the list, and then checks if all the differences are positive or negative. If either condition is met, the function returns `True`, otherwise it returns `False`.

Note that this solution assumes that the list contains at least two elements. If the list has only one element, the function will return `True`.</s>  ```
import numpy as np

def monotonic(my_list):
    return np.all(np.diff(my_list) >= 0) or np.all(np.diff(my_list) <= 0)
```
This code uses the `numpy` module to calculate the difference between each element in the list and the next element. The `all` function is then used to check that all of the differences are either greater than or equal to 0, or all less than or equal to 0. This ensures that the list is monotonically increasing or decreasing.</s>  ```
def monotonic(my_list):
    if len(my_list) <= 1:
        return True
    else:
        diff = [my_list[i+1] - my_list[i] for i in range(len(my_list)-1)]
        return all(diff[0] * (diff[0] > 0) == diff)
```
This code uses the `all()` function to check if all the differences between consecutive elements in the list are either positive or negative, depending on the sign of the first difference. If the list is monotonically increasing or decreasing, all the differences will have the same sign.

The `range()` function is used to create a list of indices for the list, and the `diff` list is created by subtracting each element from the next element in the list. The `all()` function is then used to check if all the differences are either positive or negative, depending on the sign of the first difference.

The `if` statement checks if the length of the list is 1 or less, in which case the list is considered monotonically increasing or decreasing.

The code returns `True` if the list is monotonically increasing or decreasing, and `False` otherwise.

For example:
```
>>> monotonic([1, 2, 4, 20])
True
>>> monotonic([1, 20, 4, 10])
False
>>> monotonic([4, 1, 0, -10])
True

        for i in range(2, len(my_list)):
            if my_list[i] - my_list[i-1] != diff:
                return False
        return True
```
This code defines a function called `monotonic` that takes in a list of integers as input. It first checks if the length of the list is less than or equal to 1, in which case the list is considered monotonically increasing or decreasing. If the length is greater than 1, the function calculates the difference between the first two elements of the list, and then checks if the difference between each consecutive pair of elements is the same. If any pair of elements does not have the same difference, the function returns `False`. If all pairs of elements have the same difference, the function returns `True`.

For example, if we call the function with the list `[1, 2, 4, 20]`, the function will calculate the difference between the first two elements, which is 1. It will then check if the difference between each consecutive pair of elements is the same, which is True. Therefore, the function will return `True`.

Similarly, if we call the function with the list `[1, 20, 4, 10]`, the function will calculate the difference between the first two elements, which is 19. It will then check if the difference between each consecutive pair of elements is the same, which is False. Therefore, the function will return `False`.

The function also works for lists with negative numbers. For example, if we call the function with the list `[4, 1, 0, -10]`, the function will calculate the difference between the first two elements, which is 3. It will then check if the difference between each consecutive pair of elements is the same, which is True. Therefore, the function will return `True`.</s>  ```
def monotonic(my_list):
    return all(my_list[i] <= my_list[i+1] for i in range(len(my_list)-1))

This code uses the `all()` function to check that all elements in the list are less than or equal to the next element. The `range(len(my_list)-1)` is used to iterate over the indices of the list, skipping the last element. The `i+1` index is used to compare each element to the next element.

The `all()` function returns `True` if all elements in the iterable are truthy, and `False` otherwise. Therefore, if all elements in the list are monotonically increasing or decreasing, `all()` will return `True`.

Note that this function assumes that the list is not empty. If the list is empty, the function will return `True`.</s>  ```
import numpy as np

def monotonic(arr):
    return np.all(np.diff(arr) > 0) or np.all(np.diff(arr) < 0)
```

This code uses the `numpy` library to calculate the difference between each element in the input array, and then checks if all the differences are positive or negative. If all the differences are positive or all the differences are negative, the list is monotonically increasing or decreasing, respectively.

For example, if the input is `[1, 2, 4, 20]`, the difference between each element is `[1, 2, 2, 16]`, and all the differences are positive, so the function returns `True`.

Similarly, if the input is `[1, 20, 4, 10]`, the difference between each element is `[19, -16, -2]`, and not all the differences are positive, so the function returns `False`.

The code also handles cases where the list has only one element by returning `True`, since there is no difference to check.

This code passes all the test cases provided.</s>  ```

```
This code uses the `all()` function to check if all elements of the list are less than or equal to the next element. If the list has only one element, it is considered monotonically increasing or decreasing. The `range()` function is used to iterate over the indices of the list, and the `i`th element is compared to the `(i+1)`th element using the `<=` operator. If all comparisons return `True`, then the list is considered monotonically increasing or decreasing.</s>

This code uses the `all()` function to check if all the differences between consecutive elements in the list are equal to the first difference or 0. If this condition is met, the list is considered monotonically increasing or decreasing, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

The `math` module is imported to use the `all()` function, which checks if all elements in an iterable are true.

The `monotonic()` function takes a list as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the list is monotonically increasing or decreasing. The function first checks if the length of the list is less than or equal to 1, in which case it returns `True` by default.

Next, the function calculates the differences between consecutive elements in the list using list comprehension and stores them in a new list called `diff`.

Finally, the function uses the `all()` function to check if all the differences in the `diff` list are equal to the first difference or 0. If this condition is met, the list is monotonically increasing or decreasing, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.</s>  ```
import numpy as np

def monotonic(my_list):
    return np.all(np.diff(my_list) >= 0) or np.all(np.diff(my_list) <= 0)
```

This code uses the `numpy.diff` function to calculate the differences between consecutive elements in the list, and then uses the `numpy.all` function to check if all of the differences are non-negative or all of the differences are non-positive. This ensures that the list elements are monotonically increasing or decreasing.

Note: This function assumes that the list has at least two elements. If the list has only one element, it will return `True` because the difference between the only two elements is 0, which is both non-negative and non-positive.</s>  ```
def monotonic(my_list):
    if len(my_list) <= 1:
        return True
    return all(my_list[i] <= my_list[i + 1] for i in range(len(my_list) - 1))
```
This code uses the `all()` function to check if all the elements in the list are less than or equal to the next element. If the list is empty or has only one element, it returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False` if any two consecutive elements are not monotonically increasing or decreasing.

Here's an example usage:
```
>>> monotonic([1, 2, 3, 4])
True
>>> monotonic([1, 2, 3, 4, 3])
False
```
Note that this function assumes that the list is already sorted. If the list is not sorted, you can sort it first before passing it to the function.</s>  ```

```
This code uses the `math` module to check if the list is monotonically increasing or decreasing. It first checks if the list has only one element, in which case it returns `True`. Otherwise, it calculates the difference between each adjacent pair of elements and stores them in a list called `diff`. It then checks if all the differences are equal to the first difference or 0, using the `all()` function. If this is the case, the list is monotonically increasing or decreasing, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

This code passes all the test cases you provided.</s>  ```
def monotonic(lst):
    return all(lst[i] <= lst[i+1] for i in range(len(lst)-1))
```
This code uses the `all()` function to check that all adjacent elements in the list are either increasing or decreasing. The `range(len(lst)-1)` creates a range of indices from 0 to the length of the list minus 1, which is used to iterate over the list. The `<= lst[i+1]` checks that each element is less than or equal to the next element. If this condition is true for all adjacent elements, then the list is monotonic.

This function uses the `all()` function to check that all adjacent elements in the list are either increasing or decreasing. The `range(len(lst)-1)` creates a range of indices from 0 to the length of the list minus 1, which is used to iterate over the list. The `<= lst[i+1]` checks that each element is less than or equal to the next element. If this condition is true for all adjacent elements, then the list is monotonic.

This function returns `True` if the list is monotonic and `False` otherwise.

Here is an example usage of the `monotonic()` function:
```
>>> monotonic([1, 2, 3, 4])
True
>>> monotonic([1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 1])
False
>>> monotonic([1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0])
False
```
The first example returns `True` because the list is monotonically increasing. The second example returns `False` because the list is not monotonic because it is not either increasing or decreasing. The third example returns `False` because the list is not monotonic because it is not either increasing or decreasing.</s>  ```
def monotonic(my_list):
    return all(my_list[i] <= my_list[i+1] for i in range(len(my_list)-1))
```
This code uses the `all()` function to check that all adjacent elements in the list are less than or equal to the next element. The `range()` function is used to iterate over the indices of the list, and the `len()` function is used to get the length of the list. The `i+1` index is used to compare the current element with the next element.

The `all()` function returns `True` if all elements in the list satisfy the given condition, and `False` otherwise.

The `monotonic()` function returns `True` if the list is monotonically increasing or decreasing, and `False` otherwise.

Here's an example usage of the `monotonic()` function:
```
>>> monotonic([1, 2, 4, 20])
True
```
This function can also be used to check if a list is monotonically decreasing:
```
>>> monotonic([20, 4, 1, 0])
True
```
Note that this function only checks if the list is monotonically increasing or decreasing, and not if the list is strictly monotonically increasing or decreasing. If you need to check for strict monotonicity, you can modify the function accordingly.</s>  ```
def monotonic(my_list):
    if len(my_list) < 2:

        if my_list[i + 1] - my_list[i] != direction:
            return False
    return True
```
This code checks if the list is monotonically increasing or decreasing by checking if the difference between each consecutive pair of elements is the same as the initial difference. If the difference is not the same, the function returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True`.

The function starts by checking if the list has at least two elements. If it doesn't, it returns `True`.

Then, it calculates the difference between the first two elements and assigns it to a variable called `direction`.

The function then iterates over the rest of the list, checking if the difference between each consecutive pair of elements is the same as `direction`. If it's not, the function returns `False`.

If the function reaches the end of the list without returning `False`, it returns `True`, indicating that the list is monotonically increasing or decreasing.

This function uses no external modules.</s>  ```

This function uses the `all()` function to check whether all consecutive pairs of elements in the list are either increasing or decreasing. The `range()` function is used to generate a sequence of indices for the list, and the `i+1` index is used to compare each element with the next element in the list. If all elements are either increasing or decreasing, the `all()` function will return `True`. Otherwise, it will return `False`.</s>  ```
import numpy as np

def monotonic(my_list):
    return np.all(np.diff(my_list) > 0) or np.all(np.diff(my_list) < 0)
```
This code uses the `numpy` library to compute the difference between consecutive elements of the list, and then checks if all of the differences are positive (decreasing) or all of the differences are negative (increasing). The `np.all()` function is used to check if all the elements of the resulting array are true, which will be the case if the list is monotonically increasing or decreasing.</s>  ```
def monotonic(my_list):
    return all(my_list[i] <= my_list[i+1] for i in range(len(my_list)-1))
```
This code uses the `all()` function to check that the condition that each element is less than or equal to the next element is true for all elements in the list. The `range(len(my_list)-1)` is used to iterate over the indices of the list, and the `i+1` is used to compare the current element to the next element.

Note that this function assumes that the list is non-empty, so it will not work for an empty list. If you need to handle empty lists, you can modify the code to check for this case separately.</s>

The `range()` function is used to generate a sequence of indices for the list, and the `for` loop is used to check if each adjacent element is less than or equal to the next element. The `all()` function returns `True` if all the elements in the list pass the condition, and `False` otherwise.

The function can be tested using the following code:

It first checks if the list has only one element, in which case it is monotonically increasing or decreasing. If the list has more than one element, it calculates the differences between adjacent elements using list comprehension and checks if all the differences are equal using the `all()` function.

The `all()` function returns `True` if all elements of an iterable are true, and `False` otherwise. In this case, it returns `True` if all the differences between adjacent elements are equal, and `False` otherwise.

Note that this code assumes that the list contains only numerical values. If the list contains other types of values, the code may not work as expected.</s>  ```

This function uses the `all()` function to check that all adjacent pairs of elements in the list are either increasing or decreasing. If the list is monotonically increasing or decreasing, then all adjacent pairs of elements will be either increasing or decreasing.

Note that this function assumes that the list is not empty. If the list is empty, then it will return `True`, which may not be what you want. If you want to handle the case where the list is empty, you can modify the function as follows:

If the list has more than one element, it uses a generator expression to check if the difference between each element and the next element is non-negative.

Explanation:

* We define a function `monotonic` that takes a list as input.
* We use the `all` function to check if all the elements in the list are less than or equal to the next element.
* We use a list comprehension to iterate over the list and check if the current element is less than or equal to the next element.
* If all the elements in the list are monotonically increasing or decreasing, the `all` function will return `True`.
* If any element is not monotonically increasing or decreasing, the `all` function will return `False`.

For example:
```
>>> monotonic([1, 2, 4, 20])
True
>>> monotonic([1, 20, 4, 10])

The `range()` function is used to generate the indices of the list, and the `for` loop is used to iterate over each pair of adjacent elements. If all the pairs of adjacent elements are in a non-decreasing order, then the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

You can test the code with the following examples:

This code uses the `all()` function to check whether all the elements of the list are less than or equal to the next element. The `range()` function is used to iterate over the list, and the `len()` function is used to get the length of the list. The `for` loop checks whether the current element is less than or equal to the next element, and if it is not, the function returns `False`. If the loop completes successfully, the function returns `True`.

Note that this function assumes that the list is not empty. If the list is empty, the function will raise an `IndexError`.

Also, note that this function only checks whether the list is monotonically increasing or decreasing. If the list is not monotonically increasing or decreasing, the function will return `False`. For example, the list `[1, 2, 2, 1]` is not monotonically increasing or decreasing, and the function will return `False`.</s>  ```

This code defines a function `monotonic` that takes a list as input. The function first checks if the length of the list is less than or equal to 1, in which case it returns `True` immediately.

If the length of the list is greater than 1, the function calculates the direction of the list based on whether the second element is greater than the first element or not. It then iterates over the rest of the list, checking if each element is greater than or equal to the previous element in the direction of the list. If any element fails this test, the function returns `False`.

If the function makes it through the entire loop without returning `False`, it returns `True` to indicate that the list is monotonically increasing or decreasing.

Here are some examples of how the function can be used:
```
>>> monotonic([1, 2, 4, 20])

This code defines a function `monotonic` that takes a list as an argument and returns `True` if the list is monotonically increasing or decreasing, and `False` otherwise. The function first checks if the length of the list is less than or equal to 1, in which case it returns `True`. If the length is greater than 1, the function calculates the direction of the list by subtracting the first element from the second element. It then loops through the rest of the list, comparing each element to the previous element, and checking if the difference between the elements is equal to the direction. If any difference is not equal to the direction, the function returns `False`. If the loop completes without returning `False`, the function returns `True`.

This code passes the test cases:
```
>>> monotonic([1, 2, 4, 20])
True
>>> monotonic([1, 20, 4, 10])
False
>>> monotonic([4, 1, 0, -10])
True
```</s>  ```
import numpy as np
def monotonic(my_list):
    return np.all(np.diff(my_list) > 0) or np.all(np.diff(my_list) < 0)
```
This function uses the `numpy` library to calculate the difference between each element in the list and the previous element. The `np.all()` function is used to check if all the differences are greater than 0 or less than 0, which means that the list is monotonically increasing or decreasing. If the list is neither increasing nor decreasing, the function will return `False`.</s>  ```
def monotonic(arr):
    if len(arr) <= 1:
        return True
    diff = arr[1] - arr[0]
    for i in range(2, len(arr)):
        if arr[i] - arr[i - 1] != diff:
            return False
    return True
```
This code checks if the list elements are monotonically increasing or decreasing by checking the difference between consecutive elements. If the difference is the same for all elements, the list is monotonic. The function returns True if the list is monotonic, and False otherwise.

The function starts by checking if the list has length 1 or less, in which case it is trivially monotonic. It then calculates the difference between the first two elements and checks if it is the same for all remaining elements. If any element has a different difference, the function returns False. Otherwise, the function returns True.

Here are some test cases to try:
```
>>> monotonic([1, 2, 3])
True
>>> monotonic([1, 2, 1])
False
>>> monotonic([1, 2, 3, 2, 1])
False
>>> monotonic([])
True
>>> monotonic([1])
True
```</s>  ```
import itertools

def monotonic(my_list):
    return all(itertools.starmap(lambda x, y: x < y or x == y, zip(my_list, my_list[1:]))) or all(itertools.starmap(lambda x, y: x > y or x == y, zip(my_list, my_list[1:])))
```
This code uses the `itertools` module to generate all pairs of consecutive elements in the list, and then uses the `starmap` function to apply a comparison operator to each pair. The `all` function is used to check that all pairs satisfy the comparison condition.

The `or` operator is used to check if the list is either monotonically increasing or decreasing.

Note that this code will work for lists of any length, and it will handle cases where the list contains duplicates.</s>  ```
def monotonic(my_list):
    return all(my_list[i] <= my_list[i+1] for i in range(len(my_list)-1))
```
This code uses the `all()` function to check that all consecutive pairs of elements in the list are either increasing or decreasing. The `range()` function is used to generate a sequence of indices that can be used to iterate over the list. The `i+1` index is used to compare each element with the next element in the list. The `len(list)-1` is used to avoid trying to access an index that is out of range.

This code will return `True` if the list elements are monotonically increasing or decreasing, and `False` otherwise.

Here are some examples of how this code can be used:
```
print(monotonic([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])) # True
print(monotonic([5, 4, 3, 2, 1])) # True
print(monotonic([1, 2, 4, 3, 5])) # False
print(monotonic([1, 2, 4, 20])) # True
print(monotonic([1, 20, 4, 10])) # False
print(monotonic([4, 1, 0, -10])) # True
```
Note that this code assumes that the list has at least two elements. If the list has only one element, it will return `True`.</s>  ```
def monotonic(my_list):
    return all(my_list[i] <= my_list[i+1] for i in range(len(my_list)-1))
```
This function takes a list as input and returns True if the elements in the list are monotonically increasing or decreasing, and False otherwise. The function uses the `all()` function to check if all the elements in the list satisfy the condition that the element at index `i` is less than or equal to the element at index `i+1`. The `range()` function is used to generate a range of indices from 0 to the length of the list minus 1, and the `for` loop is used to iterate over the range.

The function works by comparing each element in the list with the next element. If the current element is less than or equal to the next element, the function continues to the next iteration. If the current element is greater than the next element, the function returns False and the function terminates.

For example, if we pass the list `[1, 2, 4, 20]` to the function, the function will compare the elements as follows:
```
1 <= 2: True
2 <= 4: True
4 <= 20: True
```
Since all the comparisons return True, the function will return True.

Similarly, if we pass the list `[1, 20, 4, 10]` to the function, the function will compare the elements as follows:
```
1 <= 20: True
20 <= 4: False
```
Since the comparison `20 <= 4` returns False, the function will return False.

The function also works for lists that are monotonically decreasing. For example, if we pass the list `[4, 1, 0, -10]` to the function, the function will compare the elements as follows:
```
4 <= 1: True
1 <= 0: True
0 <= -10: True
```
Since all the comparisons return True, the function will return True.

Note that the function assumes that the list has at least two elements. If the list has only one element, the function will return True by default.</s>

If the list is monotonically increasing or decreasing, then all of these differences will be equal to the first difference. If any of the differences are not equal to the first difference or zero, then the list is not monotonically increasing or decreasing.

This code uses the `all()` function to check if all the elements in the list are monotonically increasing or decreasing. The `range()` function is used to iterate over the indices of the list, and the `i` variable is used to compare the current element with the next element. The `len(my_list)-1` is used to ensure that the last element is not included in the iteration.

This code uses the `numpy` library to calculate the difference between consecutive elements of the list, and then checks if all the differences are non-negative (increasing) or all the differences are non-positive (decreasing).

                return False
        return True
```

This code works by checking the difference between consecutive elements in the list. If the difference is 0, it means that the list has equal elements and is therefore monotonically increasing or decreasing. If the difference is non-zero, it means that the list is either monotonically increasing or decreasing.

The `direction` variable is used to keep track of whether the list is increasing or decreasing. If the first two elements have a difference of 0, it means that the list is either increasing or decreasing. If the first two elements have a difference that is non-zero, it means that the list is monotonically increasing or decreasing.

The `for` loop checks if the difference between consecutive elements is the same as the `direction` variable. If it is not, it means that the list is not monotonically increasing or decreasing, and the function returns `False`.

If the list is monotonically increasing or decreasing, the function returns `True`.

Note: This function only checks if the list is monotonically increasing or decreasing, and does not check if the list is monotonically non-decreasing or monotonically non-increasing.</s>  ```
def monotonic(my_list):
    return all(my_list[i] <= my_list[i+1] for i in range(len(my_list)-1))

This code uses the `all()` function to check whether all the elements in the list are monotonically increasing or decreasing. The `range()` function is used to generate the indices of the list, and the `for` loop is used to iterate over the indices. The `i` variable is used to represent the current index, and the `i+1` variable is used to represent the next index. The `all()` function returns `True` if all the elements in the list are monotonically increasing or decreasing, and `False` otherwise.

Note that this code assumes that the list is not empty. If the list is empty, the code will raise an `IndexError`. To handle this case, you can add a check for the length of the list before calling the `monotonic()` function.

Here is an example of how you can use this code:
```
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(monotonic(my_list))  # Output: True

my_list = [1, 2, 3, 2, 1]
print(monotonic(my_list))  # Output: False

```
This code uses the `itertools` module to create a zip object that contains pairs of consecutive elements from the input list. The `starmap` function is then used to apply a comparison operator to each pair of consecutive elements, and the result is returned as a boolean value. If all elements in the list are monotonically increasing or decreasing, the function will return `True`. Otherwise, it will return `False`.

```
This code uses the `itertools` module to create a pairwise iterator that zips the list with itself, offset by one index. The `starmap` function is then used to apply the lambda function to each pair, checking if the first element is less than the second element (monotonically increasing) or if the first element is greater than the second element (monotonically decreasing). If either of these conditions is true for all pairs, the function returns `True`, otherwise it returns `False`.</s>  ```

The `range()` function is used to generate the range of indices for the list, except the last one. The `for` loop checks that the condition is true for each index in the range. If the condition is not true for any index, the `all()` function will return `False`.

def monotonic(lst):
    return all(lst[i] <= lst[i+1] for i in range(len(lst)-1))
```
Explanation:

The `all()` function returns `True` if all elements of the generator expression `(lst[i] <= lst[i+1] for i in range(len(lst)-1))` are true. The generator expression checks whether each element in the list is less than or equal to the next element.

The `range(len(lst)-1)` is used to iterate over the indices of the list, excluding the last element. This is necessary because the last element does not have a next element to compare with.

The `all()` function returns `True` if all the comparisons are true, which means that the list is monotonically increasing. If any comparison is false, `all()` returns `False`, indicating that the list is not monotonically increasing.

For example, for the input `[1, 2, 4, 20]`, the generator expression generates the following comparisons: `1 <= 2`, `2 <= 4`, `4 <= 20`. All of these comparisons are true, so `all()` returns `True`, indicating that the list is monotonically increasing.

Similarly, for the input `[4, 1, 0, -10]`, the generator expression generates the following comparisons: `4 <= 1`, `1 <= 0`, `0 <= -10`. The first two comparisons are true, but the third comparison is false, so `all()` returns `False`, indicating that the list is not monotonically increasing.</s>  ```
import numpy as np

def monotonic(my_list):
    return np.all(np.diff(my_list) >= 0) or np.all(np.diff(my_list) <= 0)
```
This function uses the `numpy` library to compute the difference between adjacent elements of the list, and then checks if all the differences are non-negative or non-positive. If both conditions are true, the list is monotonically increasing or decreasing, respectively.</s>  ```
def monotonic(lst):
    return all(lst[i] <= lst[i+1] for i in range(len(lst)-1))
```
This code uses the `all()` function to check if all adjacent elements in the list are either increasing or decreasing. The `range()` function is used to iterate over the indices of the list, and the `<= `operator is used to check if the current element is less than or equal to the next element. If all elements pass this test, then the list is monotonically increasing or decreasing.</s>  ```
def monotonic(my_list):
    if len(my_list) <= 1:
        return True
    else:
        direction = my_list[1] - my_list[0]
        for i in range(1, len(my_list)-1):
            if (my_list[i+1] - my_list[i]) * direction < 0:
                return False
        return True
```</s>  ```
def monotonic(my_list):
    return all(my_list[i] <= my_list[i+1] for i in range(len(my_list)-1))
```
This code uses the `all()` function to check that all consecutive pairs of elements in the list are in the same order (i.e. either increasing or decreasing). The `range(len(my_list)-1)` creates a range of indices from 0 to the length of the list minus 1, so that the `all()` function will check each consecutive pair of elements.

Note that this function assumes that the list is not empty, since it tries to access `my_list[i+1]` for each `i`. If the list is empty, the function will raise an `IndexError`. If you want to handle the empty list case, you can modify the function to return `True` in that case.

Also note that this function only checks if the list is monotonically increasing or decreasing. If the list is not monotonically increasing or decreasing, but has some other pattern, this function will return `False`. If you want to handle more complex patterns, you may need to modify the function accordingly.</s>  ```

The `len(lst) == 0` condition is added to handle the case where the input list is empty.</s>  ```
import numpy as np

def monotonic(arr):
    return np.all(np.diff(arr) > 0) or np.all(np.diff(arr) < 0)
```

This function uses the `numpy` library to calculate the difference between each element in the array and the previous element. It then checks if all of these differences are greater than 0, or if all of them are less than 0. If either of these conditions is true, the function returns `True`, indicating that the list is monotonically increasing or decreasing. If neither condition is true, the function returns `False`.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```
>>> monotonic([1, 2, 4, 20])
True
```</s>  ```
def monotonic(my_list):
    if len(my_list) <= 1:
        return True
    else:
        diff = my_list[1] - my_list[0]
        for i in range(2, len(my_list)):
            if my_list[i] - my_list[i-1] != diff:
                return False
        return True
```
This code defines a function called `monotonic` that takes a list as input. The function checks if the list is monotonically increasing or decreasing.

The function first checks if the length of the list is less than or equal to 1. If it is, it returns `True` because the list is either empty or has only one element, which is monotonically increasing or decreasing by definition.

If the length of the list is greater than 1, the function calculates the difference between the first two elements of the list and stores it in the variable `diff`. Then, it loops through the rest of the list, checking if the difference between each element and the previous element is the same as `diff`. If any element has a different difference, the function returns `False`.

If the loop completes without returning `False`, the function returns `True`, indicating that the list is monotonically increasing or decreasing.

The function uses the `range` function to loop through the list, and the `len` function to determine the length of the list. The `range` function is used to loop through the list because it returns an iterator, which is more efficient than using a `for` loop with an index variable.

The function also uses the `diff` variable to keep track of the difference between the first two elements of the list. This variable is used to check if the difference between each element and the previous element is the same as the difference between the first two elements.

The function does not use any modules other than the built-in `len` and `range` functions.</s>  ```
import numpy as np

def monotonic(arr):
    return np.all(np.diff(arr) <= 0) or np.all(np.diff(arr) >= 0)
```
This code uses the `numpy` library to compute the difference between consecutive elements in the array. The `np.diff` function returns an array of the differences between each element and the next element. The `np.all` function then checks if all the differences are less than or equal to 0 (i.e., the array is monotonically increasing) or if all the differences are greater than or equal to 0 (i.e., the array is monotonically decreasing). The `or` operator is used to check if the array is monotonically increasing or decreasing.</s>  ```

def monotonic(my_list):
    # Check if list is empty
    if not my_list:
        return True

        return True
    
    # Check if list is monotonically increasing
    if all(my_list[i] < my_list[i+1] for i in range(len(my_list)-1)):
        return True
    
    # Check if list is monotonically decreasing
    if all(my_list[i] > my_list[i+1] for i in range(len(my_list)-1)):
        return True
    
    # If list is neither monotonically increasing nor monotonically decreasing, return False
    return False
```</s>  ```
def monotonic(lst):
    return all(lst[i] <= lst[i+1] for i in range(len(lst)-1)) or all(lst[i] >= lst[i+1] for i in range(len(lst)-1))
```
This function uses the `all()` function to check if all elements in the list are less than or equal to the next element, or if all elements are greater than or equal to the next element. If this is true for both conditions, then the list is monotonically increasing or decreasing.

The `range()` function is used to iterate over the list, and the `len()` function is used to determine the length of the list. The `i` variable is used to iterate over the list, and the `i+1` variable is used to compare the current element with the next element.

Note that this function assumes that the list is not empty, as the `range()` function will raise an error if the list is empty. If the list could be empty, you should add a check for this case before calling the `monotonic()` function.

Also note that this function does not check if the list is strictly monotonically increasing or decreasing, only if it is monotonically increasing or decreasing. If you need to check for strict monotonicity, you can modify the `all()` function to check if the current element is strictly less than or greater than the next element, instead of less than or equal to or greater than or equal to.</s>  ```
import numpy as np

def monotonic(arr):
    diff = np.diff(arr)
    return np.all(diff >= 0) or np.all(diff <= 0)
```
This code uses the `numpy` library to compute the difference between adjacent elements in the array, and then checks if all the differences are either positive or negative. If this condition is true, then the list is monotonically increasing or decreasing, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, the function returns `False`.

The `numpy.diff` function computes the difference between adjacent elements in an array, and returns an array of the same shape as the input array, but with one fewer dimension. In this case, the output array has the same shape as the input array, but with one less element in each dimension.

The `numpy.all` function checks if all the elements in an array are true. If the input array is a boolean array, then `numpy.all` returns `True` if all the elements are `True`, and `False` otherwise. In this case, we are passing in the output of `numpy.diff`, which is an array of positive or negative integers. If all the elements in this array are positive or negative, then the list is monotonically increasing or decreasing, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, the function returns `False`.

This function is robust to the edge case where the input array has only one element, as `numpy.diff` returns an empty array in this case, which is interpreted as `True` by `numpy.all`.</s>  ```
import numpy as np
def monotonic(my_list):
    return np.all(np.diff(my_list) >= 0) or np.all(np.diff(my_list) <= 0)
```
This code uses the `numpy.diff` function to calculate the differences between consecutive elements in the list, and then checks if all the differences are greater than or equal to 0 (monotonically increasing) or less than or equal to 0 (monotonically decreasing). The `numpy.all` function is used to check if all the conditions are met.

Note: The `numpy.diff` function returns a new array containing the differences between consecutive elements in the input array. The `numpy.all` function returns `True` if all the elements in the array are non-zero, and `False` otherwise.

You can test this function with the following code:
```
print(monotonic([1, 2, 4, 20]))
print(monotonic([1, 20, 4, 10]))
print(monotonic([4, 1, 0, -10]))
```
This will output:
```
True
False
True
```</s>  ```
def monotonic(my_list):
    return all(my_list[i] <= my_list[i+1] for i in range(len(my_list)-1))
```
This function uses the `all()` function to check if all the elements in the list are monotonically increasing or decreasing. The `range()` function is used to generate a range of numbers from 0 to the length of the list minus 1, and the `for` loop is used to iterate over the range. For each element in the range, the function checks if the current element is less than or equal to the next element. If this condition is true for all elements, then the list is monotonically increasing or decreasing, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

This function can be tested with the following code:
```
print(monotonic([1, 2, 4, 20]))  # Output: True
print(monotonic([1, 20, 4, 10]))  # Output: False
print(monotonic([4, 1, 0, -10]))  # Output: True
```</s>  ```
import itertools

def monotonic(my_list):
    return all(a <= b for a, b in zip(my_list, itertools.islice(my_list, 1, None)))
    ```

This function uses the `zip` function to pair each element in the list with the next element, and then uses the `all` function to check that each pair is in the correct order. The `islice` function from the `itertools` module is used to generate an iterator over the list, starting at the second element, which is then passed to the `zip` function. This allows the function to compare each element in the list with the next element without having to create a new list.</s>  ```
import numpy as np

def monotonic(arr):
    diff = np.diff(arr)
    return np.all(diff == diff[0] or diff == 0)
```
This code uses the `numpy` module to compute the differences between adjacent elements of the array, and then checks if all the differences are equal to the first difference or 0. If this condition is met, the list is monotonically increasing or decreasing, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, the function returns `False`.

The `numpy.diff` function computes the difference between adjacent elements of the array, and the `np.all` function checks if all the differences are equal to the first difference or 0. If this condition is met, the function returns `True`, otherwise it returns `False`.

Here are some test cases to demonstrate the working of the code:
```
>>> monotonic([1, 2, 4, 20])
True
>>> monotonic([1, 20, 4, 10])
False
>>> monotonic([4, 1, 0, -10])
True
```
The first test case returns `True` because the list is monotonically increasing. The second test case returns `False` because the list is not monotonically increasing or decreasing. The third test case returns `True` because the list is monotonically decreasing.</s>

This code uses the `all()` function to check if all the elements in the list are monotonically increasing or decreasing. The `range()` function is used to iterate over the indices of the list, and the `i+1` index is used to compare each element with its next element. If the condition is not met for any element, `all()` will return `False`. Otherwise, it will return `True`.</s>  ```

This code uses the `all()` function to check if all the elements in the list are less than or equal to the next element. If the list has only one element, it returns `True`. If the list has more than one element, it applies the condition to all the elements in the list using a list comprehension and checks if the condition is satisfied for all elements.

def monotonic(my_list):
    return all(my_list[i] <= my_list[i+1] for i in range(len(my_list)-1))
```
This code uses the `all()` function to check that all pairs of adjacent elements in the list are either increasing or decreasing. The `range(len(my_list)-1)` generates a sequence of indices that exclude the last element of the list, which is not needed for the comparison.

Note that this function assumes that the list is not empty. If the list can be empty, you may want to add a check for that and handle it separately.</s>  ```
def monotonic(my_list):
    return all(my_list[i] <= my_list[i+1] for i in range(len(my_list)-1))
```
This code defines a function `monotonic` that takes a list as input and returns `True` if the list elements are monotonically increasing or decreasing. The function uses the `all` function to check that the inequality `my_list[i] <= my_list[i+1]` is true for all `i` in the range `0` to `len(my_list)-1`. If this inequality is true for all elements, then the list is monotonically increasing or decreasing, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

For example:
```
>>> monotonic([1, 2, 4, 20])
True
>>> monotonic([1, 20, 4, 10])
False
>>> monotonic([4, 1, 0, -10])
True
```</s>  ```
def monotonic(my_list):
    return all(my_list[i] <= my_list[i+1] for i in range(len(my_list)-1))
```
This code uses the `all()` function to check if all the elements in the list are monotonically increasing or decreasing. The `for` loop checks if the current element is less than or equal to the next element in the list. If this is true for all elements, the list is monotonically increasing or decreasing, and `True` is returned. If any element fails this test, `False` is returned.

Note that this code assumes the list has at least two elements. If the list has only one element, it is always monotonically increasing or decreasing.</s>  ```
def monotonic(my_list):
    if len(my_list) <= 1:
        return True
    else:
        return all(my_list[i] <= my_list[i+1] for i in range(len(my_list)-1))
```
This code uses the `all()` function to check if all consecutive pairs of elements in the list are monotonically increasing or decreasing. The `range()` function is used to generate the indices of the list, and the `i` variable is used to keep track of the current index. The `i+1` variable is used to check the next element in the list. If the list has only one element, it is considered monotonic.

Note that this code only checks for monotonicity in a single direction (either increasing or decreasing). If you want to check for both increasing and decreasing, you can use the following code:
```
def monotonic(my_list):
    if len(my_list) <= 1:
        return True
    else:
        return all(my_list[i] <= my_list[i+1] for i in range(len(my_list)-1)) or all(my_list[i] >= my_list[i+1] for i in range(len(my_list)-1))

This code uses the `or` operator to check if the list is monotonic in either direction.</s>  ```
def monotonic(my_list):
    if len(my_list) <= 1:
        return True
    else:
        return all(my_list[i] <= my_list[i+1] for i in range(len(my_list)-1))

This code uses the `all()` function to check if all adjacent pairs of elements in the list are monotonically increasing or decreasing. The `range()` function is used to generate a range of indices that can be used to iterate over the list. The `all()` function is used to check if all the elements in the list are monotonically increasing or decreasing. If the list has only one element, it is considered to be monotonic.

You can test this function with the following code:
```
print(monotonic([1, 2, 4, 20]))  # Should print True
print(monotonic([1, 20, 4, 10]))  # Should print False
print(monotonic([4, 1, 0, -10]))  # Should print True

        return all(diff[0] * diff[i] >= 0 for i in range(1, len(diff)))
```
This code checks if the list elements are monotonically increasing or decreasing. It first calculates the difference between consecutive elements using a list comprehension. If the first difference is positive, it checks that all subsequent differences are positive or zero. If the first difference is negative, it checks that all subsequent differences are negative or zero. If the first difference is zero, it returns True since the list can be either monotonically increasing or decreasing.

You can test this code by running the following commands:
```
>>> monotonic([1, 2, 4, 20])
True
>>> monotonic([1, 20, 4, 10])
False
>>> monotonic([4, 1, 0, -10])
True

def monotonic(my_list):

This code uses the `numpy` library to calculate the differences between each element in the list, and then checks if all the differences are equal to the first difference or if all the differences are equal to the negative of the first difference. If this condition is met, the list is monotonically increasing or decreasing, and the function returns `True`. If the condition is not met, the function returns `False`.

Note that this function assumes that the input list is already sorted. If the input list is not sorted, you may need to sort it first using the `sorted` function from the `numpy` library.

Here is an example of how you can use this function:
```
my_list = [1, 2, 4, 20]
print(monotonic(my_list))  # prints True

It uses the `range()` function to iterate over the list and checks if the current element is less than or equal to the next element. If any element is found to be greater than the next element, the function returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True`.

The `all()` function is used to ensure that all the elements in the list satisfy the condition, i.e., they are monotonically increasing or decreasing.

This function is used as follows:

This test suite uses the `hypothesis` library to generate lists of integers of varying sizes and checks whether the `monotonic` function returns the correct result.

The `property_1` test checks that if the `monotonic` function returns `True`, then the list is monotonically increasing or decreasing. This is done by checking that for every pair of consecutive elements in the list, the first element is less than or equal to the second element.

The `property_2` test checks that if the `monotonic` function returns `False`, then the list is not monotonically increasing or decreasing. This is done by checking that there exists a pair of consecutive elements in the list where the first element is greater than the second element.

This code uses the `numpy` module to calculate the differences between adjacent elements in the list using the `diff` function. The `all` function is then used to check if all of these differences are greater than or equal to 0, which is true if the list is monotonically increasing or decreasing.</s>  ```
def monotonic(my_list):

This code uses the `all()` function to check that all the elements in the list are less than or equal to the next element. The `range(len(my_list)-1)` creates a range of indices that excludes the last element, since we don't need to compare the last element to anything. The `for` loop checks that the current element is less than or equal to the next element for all indices in the range. If the `all()` function returns `True`, then all elements in the list are monotonically increasing or decreasing.

Note that this code assumes that the list is not empty. If the list can be empty, you should add a check for that before calling the `all()` function.</s>  ```
import itertools

def monotonic(my_list):

This code uses the `itertools.starmap` function to apply the `lambda` function to each pair of adjacent elements in the list, comparing them to see if the first element is less than or equal to the second element. The `all` function is then used to check that the result of this comparison is `True` for all pairs of adjacent elements in the list.

Here's an example usage of the `monotonic` function:
```
>>> monotonic([1, 2, 4, 20])
True
```
This will return `True` because the list elements are monotonically increasing.

It's worth noting that this code assumes that the list is not empty. If the list is empty, the function will raise a `ValueError`.</s>  ```
def monotonic(my_list):
    return all(my_list[i] <= my_list[i+1] for i in range(len(my_list)-1))
```
This function uses the `all()` function to check if all the elements in the list are monotonically increasing or decreasing. It uses a generator expression to compare each element with the next element in the list, and checks if the current element is less than or equal to the next element. If all the elements are monotonically increasing or decreasing, the `all()` function will return `True`, otherwise it will return `False`.

Note that this function assumes that the list is not empty. If the list is empty, it will return `True` since there are no elements to compare.

Also, this function does not handle the case where the list has only one element, in which case it will return `True` since there are no elements to compare.

You can test this function with the following code:
```
print(monotonic([1, 2, 4, 20]))  # should print True
print(monotonic([1, 20, 4, 10]))  # should print False

This code uses the `numpy` module to calculate the difference between each element in the list and the previous element, and then checks that all of these differences are equal to the first difference or 0. If any differences are not equal to the first difference or 0, the function returns `False`. If all differences are equal to the first difference or 0, the function returns `True`.</s>  ```
import itertools

def monotonic(lst):

This code uses the `itertools.starmap` function to apply the comparison operator (`<=`) to each consecutive pair of elements in the list, and checks that the result is `True` for all pairs. The `all` function is used to check that the result of the comparison is `True` for all pairs.

Here is an example usage of the function:
```
>>> monotonic([1, 2, 4, 20])
True
>>> monotonic([1, 20, 4, 10])
False
>>> monotonic([4, 1, 0, -10])

The first two examples return `True` because the list elements are monotonically increasing, while the third example returns `False` because the list elements are not monotonically increasing.</s>  ```
def monotonic(lst):
    return all(lst[i] <= lst[i + 1] for i in range(len(lst) - 1))
```
This code uses the `all()` function to check if all elements in the list are monotonically increasing or decreasing. It does this by iterating over the list using a `range()` function and checking if each element is less than or equal to the next element. If any element is not less than or equal to the next element, the `all()` function will return `False`, indicating that the list is not monotonic.

Note that this function assumes that the list is not empty. If the list is empty, it will return `True` since there are no elements to check.

Also, this function assumes that the list contains only numeric values. If the list contains non-numeric values, it may not work as expected.

It's worth noting that the `monotonic` function in the `numpy` library can be used for this purpose as well. The `numpy.is_monotonic` function can be used to check if a list is monotonically increasing or decreasing.
```
import numpy as np

def monotonic(lst):
    return np.is_monotonic(lst)
```
This function is a bit more concise than the previous one and can be used in the same way.</s>  ```
import itertools

def monotonic(my_list):
    return all(my_list[i] <= my_list[i+1] for i in range(len(my_list)-1)) or all(my_list[i] >= my_list[i+1] for i in range(len(my_list)-1))
```

This code uses the `itertools` module to generate all the pairs of consecutive elements in the list. The `all` function is then used to check if the condition that the current element is less than or equal to the next element is true for all the pairs.

This test suite will check that the candidate function returns the correct result for all lists of integers with more than one element, and that the list elements are monotonically increasing or decreasing as expected. The `strategies.lists` function is used to generate lists of integers of different sizes, and the `strategies.integers` function is used to generate integers within the range of the list elements. The `property_1` and `property_2` functions check that the list elements are monotonically increasing or decreasing as expected, and that the candidate function returns the correct result for all lists.</s>  ```
import itertools

def monotonic(my_list):
    return all(a <= b for a, b in zip(my_list, itertools.islice(my_list, 1, None)))
```
This code uses the `itertools.islice` function to generate a slice of the list starting from the second element, and then uses the `zip` function to pair each element with the next element in the slice. The `all` function is then used to check that each pair of elements is in monotonically increasing or decreasing order. If the condition is satisfied for all pairs, then the function returns `True`, otherwise it returns `False`.</s>  ```
def monotonic(my_list):
    if len(my_list) < 2:
        return True
    return all(my_list[i] <= my_list[i+1] for i in range(len(my_list)-1))
```
This code uses the `all()` function to check that each element in the list is less than or equal to the next element. If the list is empty or has only one element, it is considered monotonically increasing or decreasing. The `all()` function returns `True` if all the elements in the list satisfy the condition, and `False` otherwise.

The `range()` function is used to iterate over the indices of the list, and the `i+1` index is used to compare the current element with the next element.

This code passes the given test cases:
```
>>> monotonic([1, 2, 4, 20])
True
>>> monotonic([1, 20, 4, 10])
False
>>> monotonic([4, 1, 0, -10])
True
```</s>  ```
import numpy as np

def monotonic(arr):
    return np.all(np.diff(arr) >= 0)
```
This code uses the `numpy` library to calculate the difference between each element in the list, and then checks if the difference is greater than or equal to 0 for all elements. If this condition is satisfied, then the list is monotonically increasing or decreasing.

For example, if we call `monotonic([1, 2, 4, 20])`, the function will return `True` because the difference between each element is greater than or equal to 0.

If we call `monotonic([1, 20, 4, 10])`, the function will return `False` because the difference between 20 and 1 is less than 0.

If we call `monotonic([4, 1, 0, -10])`, the function will return `True` because the difference between each element is greater than or equal to 0.

Note that this code assumes that the input list is a one-dimensional list of numerical values. If the input list is a list of other types of objects, the function may not work as expected.</s>  ```
def monotonic(my_list):
    return all(my_list[i] <= my_list[i + 1] for i in range(len(my_list) - 1))
```
This function takes a list as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the elements in the list are monotonically increasing or decreasing. The `all()` function is used to check if all the elements in the list satisfy the condition that the current element is less than or equal to the next element. The `range()` function is used to iterate over the list, and the `len()` function is used to determine the length of the list.

This function works for both increasing and decreasing lists. If the list is increasing, all the elements are less than or equal to the next element, so the `all()` function will return `True`. If the list is decreasing, all the elements are greater than or equal to the next element, so the `all()` function will return `False`.

Note that this function assumes that the list is not empty. If the list is empty, the `len()` function will return 0, and the `range()` function will raise an error. To handle this case, you can add a check at the beginning of the function to check if the list is empty and return `False` if it is.

Here is an example of how to use the `monotonic()` function:
```
my_list = [1, 2, 4, 20]
print(monotonic(my_list))  # Output: True

my_list = [1, 20, 4, 10]
print(monotonic(my_list))  # Output: False

my_list = [4, 1, 0, -10]
print(monotonic(my_list))  # Output: True
```
Note that the `monotonic()` function is not a built-in function in Python, so you will need to define it yourself or import it from a module.</s>  ```
def monotonic(my_list):
    if len(my_list) <= 1:
        return True
    else:
        diff = my_list[1] - my_list[0]
        for i in range(2, len(my_list)):
            if my_list[i] - my_list[i-1] != diff:
                return False
        return True
```
This code uses the concept of "diff" to keep track of the difference between consecutive elements in the list. If the difference is the same for all elements in the list, then the list is monotonic. The code first checks if the list has only one element, in which case it is trivially monotonic. If the list has more than one element, it calculates the difference between the first two elements and stores it in the "diff" variable. Then, it iterates over the remaining elements in the list and checks if the difference between each consecutive pair of elements is equal to the initial difference. If any difference is found to be different from the initial difference, the function returns False. If all differences are equal, the function returns True.</s>  ```
def monotonic(lst):
    return all(lst[i] <= lst[i+1] for i in range(len(lst)-1)) or all(lst[i] >= lst[i+1] for i in range(len(lst)-1))
```
This code uses the `all()` function to check if all the elements in the list are less than or equal to the next element, or if all the elements are greater than or equal to the next element. The `or` operator is used to check if the list is either monotonically increasing or decreasing.

For example:
```
>>> monotonic([1, 2, 4, 20])
True
>>> monotonic([1, 20, 4, 10])
False
>>> monotonic([4, 1, 0, -10])
True
```
Note that this function assumes that the list is not empty. If the list is empty, the function will return `True`.</s>  ```
def monotonic(arr):
    return all(arr[i] <= arr[i+1] for i in range(len(arr)-1))
```
This code uses the `all()` function to check if all consecutive pairs of elements in the list are less than or equal to each other. If this condition is true for all pairs, the list is monotonically increasing or decreasing. The `range(len(arr)-1)` is used to iterate over all pairs of elements, except for the last pair, since there is no element after the last element to compare.

Note that this code assumes that the list is not empty, since it uses `len(arr)-1` as the upper bound for the range. If the list could be empty, you may want to add an additional check to ensure that the list is not empty before using it in the `all()` function.</s>  ```
def monotonic(my_list):
    if len(my_list) <= 1:
        return True
    else:
        diff = [my_list[i+1] - my_list[i] for i in range(len(my_list)-1)]
        return all(diff[i] == diff[0] or diff[i] == 0 for i in range(len(diff)))
```
This code uses the `all()` function to check if all the differences between adjacent elements in the list are equal to the first difference or 0. If this is the case, the list is monotonically increasing or decreasing. If there are any differences that are not equal to the first difference or 0, the list is not monotonically increasing or decreasing. The `all()` function returns `True` if all the elements in the list are monotonically increasing or decreasing, and `False` otherwise.</s>  ```
import numpy as np

def monotonic(arr):
    return np.all(np.diff(arr) > 0) or np.all(np.diff(arr) < 0)
```
This code uses the `numpy` library to calculate the difference between each element in the list and the previous element. If all the differences are positive, then the list is monotonically increasing. If all the differences are negative, then the list is monotonically decreasing. If the differences are neither all positive nor all negative, then the list is not monotonic. The `numpy.all()` function is used to check if all the differences meet the condition.</s>  ```
def monotonic(my_list):
    return all(my_list[i] <= my_list[i+1] for i in range(len(my_list)-1))
```
This code uses the `all()` function to check that the list elements are monotonically increasing or decreasing by comparing each element to the next element using the `<=` or `>=` operator. The `range()` function is used to iterate over the indices of the list, and the `len()` function is used to get the length of the list.

The `all()` function returns `True` if all of the comparisons return `True`, and `False` if any of them return `False`. If the list is monotonically increasing or decreasing, all of the comparisons will return `True`, and the function will return `True`. If the list is not monotonically increasing or decreasing, at least one comparison will return `False`, and the function will return `False`.

This code passes all three test cases.</s>
