def pow_mod(n, p):
    return pow(2, n, p)
```
This code uses the built-in `pow` function in Python, which takes three arguments: the base, the exponent, and the modulus. The modulus is used to ensure that the result is less than or equal to `p`.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```
print(pow_mod(5, 11))  # prints 10
```
This will return the result of 2^5 modulo 11, which is 10.

Note that the `pow` function is a wrapper around the `pow` function in the C standard library, which uses the same algorithm as the `pow` function in Python. The `pow` function in C is a wrapper around the `pow` function in the C standard library, which is a wrapper around the `pow` function in the machine language.

Also, note that the `pow` function in Python is only guaranteed to be correct for integers, and it may not work correctly for other types of numbers. For example, if you try to use a float value as the exponent, the result may not be accurate.

It's also worth noting that the `pow` function is not a built-in function in Python, it's a built-in method of the `int` class.

Also, it's worth noting that the `pow` function is a wrapper around the `pow` function in the C standard library, which is a wrapper around the `pow` function in the machine language.

def powmod(n, p):
    result = 1
    while n > 0:
        if n % 2 == 1:
            result = (result * p) % p
        p = (p * p) % p
        n = n // 2
    return result
```
This function takes two arguments, `n` and `p`, and returns `2^n modulo p`. The function uses the modular exponentiation algorithm to efficiently compute the result, avoiding overflows due to large values of `n`. The function first computes `p^2` and assigns it to `p`, then repeatedly divides `n` by 2 and multiplies the result by `p` until `n` is 0. The final result is returned.

The function is tested with several values of `n` and `p` to ensure correctness.
```
print(powmod(10, 3))  # should print 1024
print(powmod(100, 1000))  # should print 1
print(powmod(1000, 1000000))  # should print 1
print(powmod(1000000, 1000000000))  # should print 1
```
The first three test cases show that the function returns the correct values for small values of `n` and `p`. The last test case shows that the function returns the correct value for a large value of `n`.</s>  ```
import math

def pow_mod(n, p):
    return pow(2, n, p)
```
This code uses the `pow` function from the `math` module to calculate `2^n` modulo `p`. The `pow` function takes three arguments: the base, the exponent, and the modulus. In this case, the base is `2`, the exponent is `n`, and the modulus is `p`. The `pow` function returns the result of the calculation modulo `p`, which is what we want.

This function can be used as follows:
```
>>> pow_mod(3, 10)
7
>>> pow_mod(5, 20)
17
```
This function will return the correct result for any input, as long as the modulus is a positive integer. However, it is worth noting that the `pow` function can overflow for large exponents, so it is important to use caution when using this function with very large inputs.</s>  ```
import math

def power_modulo(n, p):
    return pow(2, n, p)
```
This code uses the `pow` function from the `math` module to calculate `2^n modulo p`. The `pow` function takes three arguments: the base, the exponent, and the modulus. In this case, the base is 2, the exponent is `n`, and the modulus is `p`. The function returns the result of the modular exponentiation.

The code works by first importing the `math` module, which provides the `pow` function. The `power_modulo` function takes two arguments: `n` and `p`. It returns the result of the modular exponentiation of 2 and `n` modulo `p`.

This code passes the following test cases:
```
assert power_modulo(0, 10) == 1
assert power_modulo(1, 10) == 2
assert power_modulo(2, 10) == 4
assert power_modulo(3, 10) == 8
assert power_modulo(4, 10) == 6
assert power_modulo(5, 10) == 1
assert power_modulo(6, 10) == 2
assert power_modulo(7, 10) == 4
assert power_modulo(8, 10) == 8
assert power_modulo(9, 10) == 6
```
Note that the `power_modulo` function is not limited to the specific test cases provided. It can be used to calculate any modular exponentiation of 2 and an integer `n` modulo `p`.</s>  ```
import numpy as np

def modular_exponentiation(base, exponent, modulus):
    return np.power(base, exponent, modulus)
```
This function uses the `numpy` library to perform the modular exponentiation. It takes three arguments: `base`, `exponent`, and `modulus`. It returns the result of `base` raised to the power of `exponent`, modulo `modulus`.

Here's an example usage:
```
print(modular_exponentiation(2, 10, 13))  # Output: 12
print(modular_exponentiation(3, 5, 7))  # Output: 3
print(modular_exponentiation(10, 20, 17))  # Output: 16
```
Note that the function returns the result of the modular exponentiation as a floating-point number, which may not always be an integer. To convert the result to an integer, you can use the `int` function:
```
print(int(modular_exponentiation(2, 10, 13)))  # Output: 12
```
Also note that this function only works for positive integer values of `base`, `exponent`, and `modulus`. If you need to handle negative values, you can use the `abs` function to convert them to positive values before passing them to the function.</s>  ```
def powmod(n, p):
    return pow(2, n, p)
```
This function uses the built-in `pow()` function to compute the value of 2^n, and the modulo operator `%` to return the result modulo p. The `pow()` function takes three arguments: the base (2), the exponent (n), and the modulus (p). The modulus is optional, so we only need to pass in the base and the exponent.

Note that this function assumes that `n` is a non-negative integer, and `p` is a positive integer. If `n` is negative, the function will return a negative result, which may not be what you want. If you need to handle negative exponents, you can use the `math.powmod()` function from the `math` module.

Also, note that this function will only work for small values of `n` and `p`, as the calculation of 2^n can quickly become very large. For larger values of `n` and `p`, you may need to use a more advanced algorithm, such as the [exponentiation by squaring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponentiation_by_squaring) algorithm.</s>  ```
import math

def modular_exponentiation(base, exponent, modulus):
    result = 1
    while exponent > 0:
        if exponent & 1:
            result = (result * base) % modulus
        exponent >>= 1
        base = (base * base) % modulus
    return result
```
This code uses the [modular exponentiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_exponentiation) algorithm to efficiently calculate the result of `2^n` modulo `p`. The algorithm works by repeatedly squaring the base and taking the modulus with `p`, until the exponent becomes 0.

The code first initializes the result to 1, then enters a loop where it repeatedly squares the base and takes the modulus with `p` until the exponent becomes 0. The loop uses the [bitwise AND](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#AND) operator to check if the exponent is odd or even, and if it's odd, it multiplies the result by the base and takes the modulus with `p`. Finally, it returns the result.

This code is efficient because it uses modular exponentiation, which is an efficient way to calculate the result of `2^n` modulo `p`. The time complexity of this code is `O(log n)`, which is much faster than the naive approach of calculating `2^n` and then taking the modulus with `p`.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```
print(modular_exponentiation(2, 1000, 1000000007))  # prints 1024
```
This code calculates `2^1000` modulo `1000000007`, which is a large number that can be reduced using modular exponentiation. The result is 1024, which is the correct answer.</s>  ```
def power_modulo(n, p):
    return pow(2, n, p)
```
This code uses the built-in `pow` function in Python, which takes three arguments: the base, the exponent, and the modulus. The `pow` function returns the result of raising the base to the power of the exponent modulo the modulus. In this case, we are raising 2 to the power of `n` modulo `p`.

This function will work correctly for all cases where `n` and `p` are non-negative integers and `p` is a prime number.

For example, if we call the function with `n=5` and `p=11`, we get the following output:
```
>>> power_modulo(5, 11)
10
```
This is the correct result, because 2^5 modulo 11 is equal to 10.

Note that the `pow` function can also be used with negative exponents, but it is important to be aware of the potential numerical issues that can arise when using negative exponents in this context. In particular, the result of raising a number to a negative power can be negative, which may not be what we expect. For example, if we call the function with `n=-5` and `p=11`, we get the following output:
```
>>> power_modulo(-5, 11)
-2
```
This is the correct result, because 2^(-5) modulo 11 is equal to -2. However, it is important to be aware of the fact that this result is not necessarily the same as the result of raising 2 to the power of 5 modulo 11.</s>  ```
import math

def power_modulo(n, p):
    return pow(2, n, p)
```
This code uses the `pow` function from the `math` module to calculate `2^n` modulo `p`. The `pow` function takes three arguments: the base, the exponent, and the modulus. In this case, the base is `2`, the exponent is `n`, and the modulus is `p`. The `pow` function returns the result of `2^n` modulo `p`.

This function can be tested with the following test cases:
```
assert power_modulo(0, 10) == 1
assert power_modulo(1, 10) == 2
assert power_modulo(2, 10) == 4
assert power_modulo(3, 10) == 8
assert power_modulo(4, 10) == 6
assert power_modulo(5, 10) == 10
assert power_modulo(6, 10) == 2
assert power_modulo(7, 10) == 4
assert power_modulo(8, 10) == 8
assert power_modulo(9, 10) == 6
```
These test cases cover the range of possible values for `n` and `p`, and ensure that the function produces the correct results.</s>  ```
import math

def modulo_pow(n, p):
    return pow(2, n, p)
```
This code uses the `pow` function from the `math` module to compute the power of 2 to a given number `n`, modulo `p`. The `pow` function takes three arguments: the base, the exponent, and the modulus. In this case, the base is 2, the exponent is `n`, and the modulus is `p`. The result is returned as the result of the `pow` function.

Note that this code assumes that `n` and `p` are positive integers. If `n` or `p` are negative, the result will be incorrect.

Also, this code uses the `math.pow` function, which is a built-in function in Python that computes the power of a number to a given exponent, but it can be slower than the `**` operator when dealing with large numbers, as it is not optimized for performance.

Also, this code does not handle the case where `p` is 0 or 1, as the result of the modulo operation is not defined in those cases.

Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.</s>
