This code uses a stack to keep track of the opening brackets. When an opening bracket is encountered, it is pushed onto the stack. When a closing bracket is encountered, it is popped from the stack. If the stack is empty at the end, then every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket. If the stack is not empty at the end, then there is an opening bracket without a corresponding closing bracket.

Here are some test cases:
```
assert check_brackets("()") == True
assert check_brackets("()()") == True
assert check_brackets("((())") == False
assert check_brackets("(()") == False
assert check_brackets("()()()") == True
```</s>  ```

            stack.pop()
    return not stack
```
This code uses a stack to keep track of the opening brackets and closing brackets. It iterates through the string and checks each character. If it encounters an opening bracket, it adds it to the stack. If it encounters a closing bracket, it checks if there is a matching opening bracket in the stack and if not, returns False. After iterating through the entire string, if the stack is not empty, it returns False, indicating that there is an unmatched opening bracket. Otherwise, it returns True.</s>  ```
def is_balanced(brackets):
    stack = []
    for bracket in brackets:
        if bracket == "(":

            if not stack:
                return False
            stack.pop()
    return not stack
```
This code uses a stack to keep track of the opening brackets and checks that each closing bracket has a corresponding opening bracket. If the stack is not empty at the end, it means that not all the opening brackets have corresponding closing brackets, and the function returns `False`. If the stack is empty, it means that all the opening brackets have corresponding closing brackets, and the function returns `True`.

Here's an example usage:
```
>>> is_balanced("()")
True
>>> is_balanced("()()")
True
>>> is_balanced("()(")
False
>>> is_balanced("((())")
False
```
Note that the `stack` module is not used in this solution.</s>  ```

                return False
            top = stack.pop()
            if top != "(":
                return False
    return len(stack) == 0
```
This function uses a stack to keep track of the opening brackets. When it encounters an opening bracket, it pushes it onto the stack. When it encounters a closing bracket, it pops the top element from the stack and checks if it is an opening bracket. If the stack is empty or the top element is not an opening bracket, the brackets are not balanced and the function returns False. If the stack is not empty at the end, the brackets are not balanced.

The function returns True if the brackets are balanced.

Here's an example usage:
```
print(is_balanced("()")) # True
print(is_balanced("(())")) # True
print(is_balanced("((())")) # False
print(is_balanced("()()")) # True
print(is_balanced("((()))")) # True
```
Note that this function assumes that the brackets are well-formed, i.e., there are no extra closing brackets or unmatched opening brackets.</s>  ```

This function uses a stack to keep track of the opening brackets. When an opening bracket is encountered, it is pushed onto the stack. When a closing bracket is encountered, it is popped from the stack. If the stack is empty at the end, then every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket.

The function returns `True` if the stack is empty at the end, indicating that every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket. If the stack is not empty at the end, then there is a mismatch between opening and closing brackets, and the function returns `False`.</s>  ```
def is_balanced(brackets):
    stack = []
    for char in brackets:
        if char == "(":
            stack.append(char)
        else:
            if not stack:
                return False
            stack.pop()
    return not stack
```
This code uses a stack to keep track of the opening brackets. When an opening bracket is encountered, it is added to the stack. When a closing bracket is encountered, it is removed from the stack. If the stack is empty at the end, it means that every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, and the function returns `True`. If the stack is not empty at the end, it means that not every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, and the function returns `False`.

Here is an example of how the function can be used:
```
print(is_balanced("()"))  # True
print(is_balanced("()("))  # False
print(is_balanced("(()"))  # False
```</s>  ```

```
This code uses a stack to keep track of the opening brackets. When an opening bracket is encountered, it is pushed onto the stack. When a closing bracket is encountered, it is popped from the stack if there is a corresponding opening bracket. If the stack is not empty at the end of the string, it means that there is an opening bracket without a corresponding closing bracket, which is not balanced.

The code returns True if the stack is empty at the end of the string, which means that every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket.

Here is an example of how the code can be used:
```
print(is_balanced("()"))  # Output: True
print(is_balanced("(()))"))  # Output: False
print(is_balanced("(())"))  # Output: True
```
The first test case passes because there are no unmatched brackets. The second test case fails because there is an opening bracket without a corresponding closing bracket. The third test case passes because there are no unmatched brackets.</s>  ```
def check_brackets(brackets):
    stack = []
    for char in brackets:

            stack.pop()
    return not stack
```
This code uses a stack to keep track of the opening brackets and their corresponding closing brackets. It works by iterating over the input string and for each character, if it is an opening bracket, it is added to the stack. If it is a closing bracket, it is removed from the stack if the corresponding opening bracket exists. If the stack is empty at the end, it means that all the opening brackets have a corresponding closing bracket.

This function can be tested with the following test case:
```
assert check_brackets("()") == True
assert check_brackets("(())") == True
assert check_brackets("(()()()") == True
assert check_brackets("(()()()") == False
assert check_brackets("(()") == False
```
Note that the test case for `check_brackets("(()")` is missing a closing bracket, which is not allowed.

Also, this function can be used as a more efficient way to check if a string contains balanced parentheses.
```
def is_balanced(s):
    return check_brackets(s)
```
This function can be tested with the following test case:
```
assert is_balanced("()") == True
assert is_balanced("((())") == True
assert is_balanced("((())") == False

```
This code uses a stack to keep track of the opening brackets. When it encounters an opening bracket, it pushes it onto the stack. When it encounters a closing bracket, it checks if there is a matching opening bracket on the stack. If not, it returns False. If there is a matching opening bracket, it pops it from the stack and continues. If the stack is not empty at the end, it means that there is an opening bracket without a matching closing bracket, so it returns False. Otherwise, it returns True.

Here's an example usage:
```
print(check_brackets("()"))  # True
print(check_brackets("(()"))  # False
print(check_brackets("((())"))  # True
print(check_brackets("((())()"))  # True
print(check_brackets("((())()()"))  # False

            if len(stack) == 0:
                return False
            top = stack.pop()
            if top != "(":
                return False
    return len(stack) == 0
```
This code uses a stack to keep track of the opening brackets. It iterates through each character in the `brackets` string and if it is an opening bracket, it adds it to the stack. If it is a closing bracket, it checks if the stack is empty and if not, it pops the top element from the stack and checks if it is an opening bracket. If either condition is not met, it returns `False`. Finally, it returns `True` if the stack is empty, indicating that all opening brackets have a corresponding closing bracket.

Note that this code assumes that the brackets are properly balanced and there are no nested brackets. If the input string contains nested brackets, the code may not work as expected.</s>
