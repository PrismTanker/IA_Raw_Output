    positive integers that start and end with 1.

  ```
from hypothesis import given, strategies

def property_test(candidate_function):
    @given(strategies.integers(min_value=1, max_value=10 ** 6))
    def property_1(n):
        result = candidate_function(n)
        assert 1 <= result <= n

    @given(strategies.lists(strategies.integers(min_value=1, max_value=10 ** 6), min_size=n, max_size=n))
    def property_2(numbers):
        result = candidate_function(len(numbers))
        assert result == sum(int(numbers[i] == 1 and numbers[i + 1] == 1) for i in range(len(numbers) - 1))

    return [property_1, property_2]
```
This test suite uses the Hypothesis library to generate inputs for the candidate function and checks that the function satisfies two properties:

1. The function returns a non-negative integer that is less than or equal to the input n.
2. The function returns the correct count of numbers that start and end with 1.

The test suite uses two different strategies to generate inputs:

* For the first property, it generates a random integer between 1 and 10^6.
* For the second property, it generates a list of n random integers between 1 and 10^6. The list is generated such that the first and last elements are 1.

The second property is tested by checking that the function returns the correct count of numbers that start and end with 1. This is done by comparing the result of the function to the expected value, which is computed by counting the number of pairs of elements in the list that start and end with 1.</s>  ```
def count_1_digit_numbers(n):
    count = 0
    for i in range(10**(n-1), 10**n):
        if str(i)[0] == '1' and str(i)[-1] == '1':
            count += 1
    return count
```</s>  To solve this problem, we can use a combination of the `str` and `range` modules to generate all possible n-digit positive integers that start and end with 1.

Here is the code:
```
import str

def count_ones(n):
    count = 0
    for i in range(10**(n-1), 10**n):
        if str(i).startswith('1') and str(i).endswith('1'):
            count += 1
    return count
```
Explanation:

* The `str` module provides a function called `startswith` that checks if a string starts with a given substring.
* The `range` module provides a function that generates a sequence of numbers from a start value to an end value.
* The `10**(n-1)` and `10**n` are used to generate the range of numbers, with `10**(n-1)` representing the start value and `10**n` representing the end value.
* The `if` statement checks if the number starts and ends with 1, and if it does, the count is incremented.
* The `return` statement returns the count.

Example usage:
```
print(count_ones(2)) # Output: 9
print(count_ones(3)) # Output: 90
print(count_ones(4)) # Output: 810
```</s>  ```
def count_1_digit_positive_integers(n):
    start = 10 ** (n - 1)
    end = (10 ** n) - 1
    return sum(int(str(i)[-1] == '1') for i in range(start, end + 1))
```
This code uses a generator expression to iterate over the range of n-digit positive integers, and then uses the string slicing operator `[-1]` to check if the last digit of each integer is equal to 1. The `sum` function is then used to calculate the total count of integers that start and end with 1.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), since we need to iterate over the range of n-digit positive integers. The space complexity is O(1), since we are not using any additional data structures to store the integers.</s>  ```
def count_ones(n):
    count = 0
    for i in range(10**(n-1), 10**n):
        if str(i)[0] == "1" and str(i)[-1] == "1":
            count += 1
    return count
```
This code uses a for loop to iterate over the range of n-digit positive integers. It then checks if the first and last digits of the integer are both 1, and if so, increments a count variable. Finally, it returns the count variable.

This code will work for any positive integer n, and will correctly return the count of n-digit positive integers that start and end with 1.</s>  ```
def count_1_digit_numbers(n):
    count = 0
    for i in range(10**(n-1), 10**n):
        if str(i)[0] == "1" and str(i)[-1] == "1":
            count += 1
    return count
```
This code uses a for loop to iterate over the range of positive integers with n digits, and checks if the first and last digits of each number are 1. If they are, the count is incremented. The final return statement returns the count of numbers that meet the criteria.</s>  To solve this problem, you can use the `str` module and the `range` function. Here is an example code:
```
import str

def count_1_digit_numbers(n):
    count = 0
    for i in range(10**(n-1), 10**n):
        if str(i)[0] == '1' and str(i)[-1] == '1':
            count += 1
    return count
```
This code uses the `range` function to generate a sequence of numbers from 10^(n-1) to 10^n, where n is the input number. It then checks if the first and last digits of each number are 1, and if so, increments a counter. Finally, it returns the value of the counter.

To test the code, you can use the following test cases:
```
assert count_1_digit_numbers(1) == 1
assert count_1_digit_numbers(2) == 2
assert count_1_digit_numbers(3) == 3
```
These test cases check that the function returns the correct number of numbers for each input value.</s>  To solve this problem, we can use a combination of string manipulation and slicing to check if the number starts and ends with 1.
```
def count_1_digit_numbers(n):
    count = 0
    for i in range(10**n):
        if str(i)[0] == "1" and str(i)[-1] == "1":
            count += 1
    return count
```
This code uses a for loop to iterate over all possible n-digit positive integers. For each integer, it converts it to a string and checks if the first and last characters are both 1. If they are, the count is incremented. Finally, the count is returned.

Note that this code assumes that the input is a positive integer. If the input is a string or negative integer, this code will not work as expected.</s>  ```
def count_1_digit_numbers(n):
    count = 0
    for i in range(10**(n-1), 10**n):
        if str(i)[0] == '1' and str(i)[-1] == '1':
            count += 1
    return count
```
This code uses a for loop to iterate through the numbers from 10^(n-1) to 10^n, and checks if the number starts and ends with 1. If it does, the count is incremented. The function returns the count at the end.</s>  ```
def count_1_digit_numbers(n):
    count = 0
    for i in range(10**(n-1), 10**n):
        if str(i)[0] == "1" and str(i)[-1] == "1":
            count += 1
    return count
```</s>  ```
def count_ones(n):
    count = 0
    for i in range(10**(n-1), 10**n):
        if str(i)[0] == '1' and str(i)[-1] == '1':
            count += 1
    return count
```
This code uses a loop to iterate over the range of possible n-digit positive integers, and checks if each integer starts and ends with the digit 1. If it does, the count is incremented. The final return value is the total count of such integers.</s>
