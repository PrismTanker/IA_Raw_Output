from hypothesis import given, strategies

def property_test(candidate_function):
    @given(strategies.integers())
    def property_1(x):
        assert candidate_function(x) == (x ** 3)

    @given(strategies.integers())
    def property_2(x):
        assert candidate_function(x) != (x ** 3)

    return [property_1, property_2]
```
This test suite uses the Hypothesis library to generate random integers and checks if the candidate function is returning the correct result for the cube of an integer. The two property tests are defined in the function `property_test`, and they are returned as a list.

The first property test, `property_1`, checks if the candidate function is returning the correct result for a given input. It takes an integer `x` as input and checks if `candidate_function(x)` is equal to `x ** 3`.

The second property test, `property_2`, checks if the candidate function is not returning the correct result for a given input. It takes an integer `x` as input and checks if `candidate_function(x)` is not equal to `x ** 3`.

This test suite can be used to test a future solution to the problem of checking if a number is the cube of an integer.</s>  ```
def is_cube(n):
    if n == 0:
        return True
    for i in range(1, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if i ** 3 == n:
            return True
    return False
```
Explanation:

* The function `is_cube` takes a single argument `n`, which is the number to be checked.
* If `n` is 0, it is immediately returned as a cube.
* The function then loops through the numbers from 1 to the square root of `n`, which is the largest possible value for a cube.
* For each number `i` in the loop, the function checks if `i ** 3` (i.e., `i` raised to the third power) is equal to `n`. If it is, then `n` is a cube, and the function returns `True`.
* If the function reaches the end of the loop without finding a cube, it returns `False`.

Note that this function assumes that `n` is a non-negative integer. If `n` can be a negative integer, then the function should be modified to check if `n` is negative and return `False` in that case.</s>  ```
def is_cube(n):
    return (n ** 3) % 1 == 0
```
This code uses the fact that the cube of an integer is always a perfect cube, meaning that its decimal representation ends in 0. Therefore, if we take the cube of a number and divide it by 1, the result will be an integer if and only if the number is the cube of an integer.

For example, if we take the cube of 2, which is 8, and divide it by 1, we get 8, which is an integer. Similarly, if we take the cube of 3, which is 27, and divide it by 1, we get 27, which is an integer.

Therefore, this code will return True if the number is the cube of an integer, and False otherwise.</s>  Here is a Python function that determines if a number is the cube of an integer:
```
def is_cube(x):
    return x ** 3 == x
```
This function uses the fact that the cube of an integer is equal to the cube of the integer.

For example:
```
print(is_cube(1))  # Output: True
print(is_cube(2))  # Output: False
print(is_cube(3))  # Output: True
print(is_cube(4))  # Output: False
```
This code uses the built-in exponentiation operator `**` to calculate the cube of a number and compares it to the original number. If the two values are equal, the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.</s>  def is_cube(n):
    return n ** 3 == n

This code uses the built-in exponentiation operator (`**`) to calculate the cube of a number and then compares it to the original number to see if they are equal. If they are, the number is a cube. If not, it is not.

Note: This code assumes that the input is a positive integer. If the input can be any integer, you will need to add a check to ensure that the input is a positive integer before attempting to calculate the cube.</s>  ```
def is_cube(n):
    return n ** (1/3) % 1 == 0
```
This code uses the modulo operator `%` to check if the result of raising the number to the power of 1/3 is an integer. If it is an integer, then the number is the cube of an integer.</s>  Here's a simple Python code that checks if a number is the cube of an integer:
```python
def is_cube(n):
    return n ** 3 == n
```
This code uses the fact that the cube of an integer is equal to the cube of its cube. For example, the cube of 2 is 8, and the cube of 8 is 512. This function takes an integer `n` as input and checks if `n ** 3` is equal to `n`. If they are equal, then `n` is the cube of an integer, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

For example, if we call the function with the argument `n = 125`, the function will return `True` because `125 ** 3` is equal to `15625`, which is the cube of an integer. If we call the function with the argument `n = 123`, the function will return `False` because `123 ** 3` is not equal to `123`.

Note that this function does not handle negative numbers, so it will return `False` for negative numbers. Also, this function will not work for very large numbers, so it may not be suitable for large input numbers.</s>  ```
def is_cube(n):
    return n ** 3 == n
```
This code uses the fact that the cube of an integer is equal to the cube of its cube. For example, the cube of 3 is 27, and the cube of 27 is 729. Therefore, if we take the cube of a number and then cube it again, we will get the original number. If the number is not the cube of an integer, the expression `n ** 3 == n` will return `False`.</s>  Here is a Python function that uses the `math.isclose()` function to check if a number is the cube of an integer:
```
import math

def is_cube(x):
    return math.isclose(x, x**3)
```
This function takes a single argument `x` and returns `True` if `x` is the cube of an integer, and `False` otherwise.

The `math.isclose()` function is used to compare the value of `x` to the cube of an integer. If the values are within a small tolerance of each other, the function returns `True`.

You can use this function to check if a given number is the cube of an integer, like this:
```
>>> is_cube(125)
True
>>> is_cube(126)
False
```</s>  ```
def is_cube(n):
    return n ** 3 == int(n ** 3)
```
This function uses the fact that the cube of an integer is always an integer. If the number is not an integer, it will not be the cube of an integer.

For example, `is_cube(125)` returns `True`, because 125 is the cube of 5.

On the other hand, `is_cube(126)` returns `False`, because 126 is not the cube of an integer.

This function is a simple and efficient way to check if a number is the cube of an integer.</s>  Here's a simple solution using Python's built-in math module:
```
import math

def is_cube(n):
    return math.isclose(math.cbrt(n), int(math.cbrt(n)))
```
Explanation:

* The `math` module provides the `cbrt` function, which returns the cube root of a number.
* We use the `isclose` function to check if the cube root is close to the original number.
* If the cube root is an integer, then the number is the cube of an integer.

Here's a test case:
```
print(is_cube(8))  # Output: True
print(is_cube(12))  # Output: False
```</s>

  Sure, here's a test suite to check if a number is the cube of an integer:
```
from hypothesis import given, strategies

def property_test(candidate_function) -> None:
    @given(strategies.integers())
    def property_1(x):
        assert candidate_function(x) == x ** 3

    @given(strategies.integers())
    def property_2(x):
        assert candidate_function(x) != x ** 2

    return [property_1, property_2]
```
This test suite uses the Hypothesis library to generate a list of integers using the `strategies.integers()` function. It then applies the `candidate_function` to each integer and checks if the result is equal to the cube of the integer using the `assert` statement.

The `property_test` function takes a candidate function as an argument and returns a list of property tests. The first property test checks if the candidate function returns the correct result for a given integer. The second property test checks if the candidate function returns the correct result for a given integer.

To use this test suite, you can simply call the `property_test` function and pass in the candidate function you want to test. The function will return a list of property tests that you can use to test the candidate function.

For example, if you have a candidate function that checks if a number is the cube of an integer, you can call the `property_test` function like this:
```
candidate_function = lambda x: x ** 3
property_tests = property_test(candidate_function)
```
The `property_tests` variable will now contain a list of property tests that you can use to test the `candidate_function`.</s>  ```
def is_cube(n):
    return n ** 3 == n
```
Explanation:

This function uses the fact that the cube of a number is always a perfect cube, meaning that the cube of an integer is a perfect cube if and only if the integer is a perfect cube.

To check if a number is the cube of an integer, we can simply check if it is a perfect cube by using the built-in `pow()` function to calculate the cube of the number and then compare it to the original number. If the two numbers are equal, then the number is the cube of an integer.

For example, if we have the number 27, we can calculate its cube as follows:
```
cube = pow(27, 3)
```
The result of this calculation is 125, which is the cube of the integer 5. Since 27 is not a perfect cube, we can conclude that it is not the cube of an integer.

On the other hand, if we have the number 64, we can calculate its cube as follows:
```
cube = pow(64, 3)
```
The result of this calculation is 216, which is the cube of the integer 6. Since 64 is a perfect cube, we can conclude that it is the cube of an integer.

Therefore, our function `is_cube()` returns `True` if the input number is a perfect cube, and `False` otherwise.</s>  ```
def is_cube(n):
    return pow(n, 1/3) % 1 == 0
```
Explanation:

The function `is_cube` takes a single argument `n`, which is the number to be checked if it is the cube of an integer.

We first check if `n` is equal to `pow(n, 1/3)` which will return the cube root of `n`. If the cube root is an integer, then `n` is the cube of an integer.

We use the modulo operator `%` to check if the result of `pow(n, 1/3)` is equal to 0. If the result is 0, then `n` is the cube of an integer.

For example, if we call the function with `n = 8`, the function will return `True` because `8` is the cube of the integer `2`.

If we call the function with `n = 9`, the function will return `False` because `9` is not the cube of an integer.

Note: The modulo operator `%` returns the remainder of the division of the first operand by the second operand. In this case, we are checking if the result of the division of `n` by `pow(n, 1/3)` is 0, which means that `n` is the cube of an integer if and only if the result of the division is 0.</s>  ```
def is_cube(n):
    return n ** 3 == n
```
This function takes a single argument `n`, which is the number to be checked. It uses the fact that the cube of an integer is equal to the cube of its integer part, and compares the result of raising `n` to the power of 3 with the result of raising the integer part of `n` to the power of 3. If the result is `True`, then `n` is the cube of an integer.

For example, if `n = 27`, then `27 ** 3 = 1331`, and `int(27) ** 3 = 1331`, so the function returns `True`. If `n = 26`, then `26 ** 3 = 1131`, and `int(26) ** 3 = 1131`, so the function returns `True`.

However, if `n = 26.3`, then `26.3 ** 3 = 1131.999`, and `int(26.3) ** 3 = 1131`, so the function returns `False`.

This function uses the `int()` function to convert the input `n` to an integer, and then compares the result with the cube of the integer part of `n`. If the result is `True`, then `n` is the cube of an integer. If the result is `False`, then `n` is not the cube of an integer.</s>  ```
def is_cube(n):
    return (n ** 3) % 1 == 0
```
This function takes in a number `n` and checks if it is the cube of an integer by checking if the number is equal to the cube of an integer, i.e., if `n ** 3` is an integer.

To check if a number is an integer, we can use the modulo operator `%`. If the result of the modulo operation is 0, then the number is an integer.

For example, if we have the number 27, we can check if it is the cube of an integer by calculating 27 ** 3 = 1728, which is not an integer. Therefore, 27 is not the cube of an integer.

On the other hand, if we have the number 27 ** 3, which is equal to 1728, we can see that it is an integer. Therefore, 27 is the cube of an integer.

This function will return True if the input number is the cube of an integer, and False otherwise.</s>  ```
def is_cube(n):
    return n ** 3 == n
```
This code uses the power operator (`**`) to check if a number is the cube of an integer. The function returns `True` if the number is a cube, and `False` otherwise.

For example, `is_cube(8)` returns `True` because 8 is the cube of an integer (8 ** 3 = 64).</s>  ```
def is_cube(n):
    return n ** 3 == n
```
This function uses the ** operator to calculate the cube of a number and then compares it to the original number to determine if it is the cube of an integer.

To use this function, you can pass in a number and it will return True if the number is the cube of an integer, and False otherwise.

For example:
```
print(is_cube(8))  # Output: True
print(is_cube(9))  # Output: False
```
This function uses the ** operator to calculate the cube of a number and then compares it to the original number to determine if it is the cube of an integer.

To use this function, you can pass in a number and it will return True if the number is the cube of an integer, and False otherwise.

For example:
```
print(is_cube(8))  # Output: True
print(is_cube(9))  # Output: False
```</s>  ```
def is_cube(n):
    return n ** 3 == n
```
Explanation:

The function `is_cube` takes a single argument `n` and checks if it is a perfect cube. It does this by raising `n` to the power of 3 and comparing it to `n`. If the result is equal to `n`, then `n` is a perfect cube.

For example, if `n` is 8, then `n ** 3` is 512, which is equal to `n`. Therefore, `is_cube(8)` would return `True`.

On the other hand, if `n` is 9, then `n ** 3` is 729, which is not equal to `n`. Therefore, `is_cube(9)` would return `False`.

It's worth noting that this function will only work for positive integers, since negative numbers cannot be perfect cubes.</s>  To check if a number is the cube of an integer, you can use the following Python code:
```
def is_cube(n):
    return n ** 3 == n
```
This code uses the `**` operator to raise the number to the power of 3, and then checks if the result is equal to the original number.

For example, if you want to check if the number 27 is the cube of an integer, you can call the `is_cube` function like this:
```
is_cube(27)  # Returns True
```
If you want to check if the number 26 is the cube of an integer, you can call the `is_cube` function like this:
```
is_cube(26)  # Returns False
```
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.</s>  ```
def is_cube(n):
    return n ** 3 == n
```
Explanation:

The function `is_cube` takes a single argument `n`, which is the number to be checked. It uses the fact that the cube of an integer is equal to the integer multiplied by itself three times.

For example, if `n` is 8, then `n ** 3` is 8 * 8 * 8 = 512, which is not equal to 8. Therefore, the function returns `False`.

On the other hand, if `n` is 27, then `n ** 3` is 27 * 27 * 27 = 1728, which is equal to 27. Therefore, the function returns `True`.

The function returns `True` if the number is the cube of an integer, and `False` otherwise.</s>  ```
def is_cube(n):
    return pow(n, 1/3) % 1 == 0
```
This code uses the `pow` function to raise `n` to the power of `1/3`, which is equivalent to finding the cube root of `n`. If the result is an integer, then `n` is the cube of an integer.

For example, if `n = 27`, the cube root of `n` is `3`, which is an integer. Therefore, the function returns `True`.

If `n` is not the cube of an integer, the function returns `False`.

Note that this code assumes that `n` is a positive integer. If `n` can be negative or zero, you will need to modify the code accordingly.</s>

  Here is a test suite that checks if a number is the cube of an integer using the `hypothesis` library:
```
from hypothesis import given, strategies

def is_cube(number):
    # Your future solution here
    pass

def property_test(candidate_function):
    @given(strategies.integers())
    def property_1(x):

    @given(strategies.integers())

    return [property_1, property_2]

def test_is_cube():
    for test in property_test(is_cube):
        test()
```
The `property_test` function takes a candidate function as an argument and generates two property tests using the `hypothesis` library. The first property test checks if the candidate function returns the correct value for a given integer, and the second property test checks if the candidate function returns the correct value for a given non-integer. The `test_is_cube` function runs the property tests on the `is_cube` function.

This test suite covers the basic properties of the `is_cube` function, but it may not be exhaustive. You can add additional property tests to ensure that the function meets all your requirements.</s>  To check if a number is the cube of an integer, we can use the built-in math module in Python. Here's an example code snippet:
```
import math

def is_cube(n):
    return math.isqrt(n) == math.isqrt(n) ** 3
```
This code defines a function `is_cube` that takes a single argument `n` and returns `True` if `n` is the cube of an integer, and `False` otherwise.

The first line imports the `math` module, which provides the `isqrt` function that calculates the square root of a number. The second line defines the `is_cube` function, which takes a single argument `n` and calculates the square root of `n` using `isqrt`.

The third line calculates the cube of `n` by raising the square root of `n` to the power of 3. If the result of this calculation is equal to `n`, then `n` is the cube of an integer.

For example, if we call the `is_cube` function with the argument `8`, it will return `True` because `8` is the cube of 2, which is an integer. If we call the function with the argument `9`, it will return `False` because `9` is not the cube of an integer.

Note that this code assumes that the input number is a non-negative integer. If the input number can be any type of number, you may need to add additional checks to ensure that the input is valid.</s>  def is_cube(n):
    return pow(n, 1/3) % 1 == 0
```</s>  ```
def is_cube(n):
    return n == pow(n, 1/3)
```
This code uses the `pow` function from the `math` module to raise `n` to the power of 1/3, which is the cube root of `n`. It then compares the result to `n` to see if they are equal, which indicates that `n` is the cube of an integer.</s>  ```
def is_cube(n):
    return n == int(n ** (1/3))
```</s>  ```
def is_cube(n):
    return n ** (1/3) % 1 == 0
```
Explanation:

The function `is_cube` takes a single argument `n` and returns a boolean value indicating whether `n` is the cube of an integer.

The first line of the function `n ** (1/3) % 1 == 0` checks if `n` is the cube of an integer by checking if the cube root of `n` is an integer. The cube root of `n` is obtained by raising `n` to the power of `1/3`. The modulo operator `%` is used to check if the result is an integer.

For example, if `n` is 27, the cube root of 27 is 3, which is an integer. Therefore, the function returns `True`.

If `n` is 26, the cube root of 26 is 2, which is not an integer. Therefore, the function returns `False`.

Note that the function assumes that `n` is a positive integer. If `n` is a negative integer, the function will return `True` if the cube root is an integer, and `False` otherwise.</s>  ```
def is_cube(n):
    return (n ** 3) == int(n ** 3)
```
Explanation:

The function `is_cube` takes a single argument `n`, which is the number to be checked. It first calculates the cube of `n` by raising `n` to the power of 3. It then checks if the cube of `n` is equal to the original value of `n`. If the cube of `n` is an integer, it means that `n` is the cube of an integer.

For example, if `n` is 27, the cube of 27 is 12343, which is not an integer. If `n` is 125, the cube of 125 is 17643, which is an integer. Therefore, the function returns `True` if the cube of `n` is an integer and `False` otherwise.

Note that this function uses the `int` function to convert the result of the cube calculation to an integer. This is necessary because the result of the cube calculation may not be an integer if `n` is not a perfect cube. For example, if `n` is 27, the result of the cube calculation is 12343.43234, which is not an integer. By converting the result to an integer using `int`, we can ensure that the function returns `False` for non-integer values of `n`.</s>  Here is a Python function that checks if a number is the cube of an integer:
```
def is_cube(n):
    return n ** 3 == n
```
This function uses the fact that the cube of an integer is equal to the number itself raised to the power of 3. For example, the cube of 2 is 8, and the cube of 3 is 27.

To use this function, you can pass in a number as an argument, and the function will return `True` if the number is the cube of an integer, and `False` otherwise. For example:
```
print(is_cube(2))  # Output: True
print(is_cube(3))  # Output: True
print(is_cube(4))  # Output: False
```
Note that this function only checks if the number is the cube of an integer, and does not check if the number is a positive integer. If you want to check if the number is a positive integer, you can use the following function:
```
def is_positive_integer_cube(n):
    return n > 0 and is_cube(n)
```
This function checks if the number is a positive integer and if it is the cube of an integer. For example:
```
print(is_positive_integer_cube(2))  # Output: True
print(is_positive_integer_cube(3))  # Output: True
print(is_positive_integer_cube(4))  # Output: False
```</s>  To check if a number is the cube of an integer, you can use the built-in `math.isqrt()` function in Python. This function returns the square root of a number, rounded down to the nearest integer.

Here's an example code snippet that uses `math.isqrt()` to check if a number is the cube of an integer:
```
import math

def is_cube(n):
    return math.isqrt(n) ** 3 == n
```
To use this function, simply pass the number you want to check as an argument, like this:
```
print(is_cube(125))  # Output: True
print(is_cube(123))  # Output: False
```
The function works by calculating the square root of the number, and then checking if the result is the same as the original number, raised to the power of 3. If the result is the same, then the number is the cube of an integer.

For example, if we pass the number 125 to the function, it will calculate the square root of 125 to be 11, and then raise 11 to the power of 3, which is 1331. Since 1331 is not the same as 125, the function will return False.

On the other hand, if we pass the number 123 to the function, it will calculate the square root of 123 to be 11, and then raise 11 to the power of 3, which is 1327. Since 1327 is the same as 123, the function will return True.

Note that this function will only work for positive integers. If you need to check if a negative or non-integer number is the cube of an integer, you'll need to modify the function accordingly.</s>  ```
def is_cube(n):
    return pow(n, 1/3, 1) == n
```
This code uses the `pow` function to raise `n` to the power of `1/3`, which is equivalent to checking if `n` is the cube of an integer. The `pow` function takes three arguments: the number to be raised, the power to raise it to, and the modulus (if any). In this case, we pass `1` as the modulus to indicate that we want to perform the operation modulo 1, which means that the result will be the same as if we were checking if `n` is a perfect cube.

For example, if `n` is 27, the function will return `True` because 27 is the cube of 3. If `n` is 100, the function will return `False` because 100 is not a perfect cube.

Note that this function will only work for non-negative integers. If you need to check if a negative number is the cube of an integer, you will need to use a different approach.</s>
