Prompt: brackets is a string of "(" and ")".
    return True if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket.
-------------------
  Here is a sample test suite for the problem:
```
{
    "balanced_brackets": {
        "in": {
            "brackets": "()"
        },
        "out": true
    },
    "unbalanced_brackets": {
        "in": {
            "brackets": "(()"
        },
        "out": false
    },
    "nested_brackets": {
        "in": {
            "brackets": "(())()"
        },
        "out": true
    }
}
```
In this test suite, we have three tests:

* "balanced_brackets" tests a string with only matching parentheses.
* "unbalanced_brackets" tests a string with unmatched parentheses.
* "nested_brackets" tests a string with nested parentheses.

Each test case is represented by a JSON object with the following structure:

* The "in" object contains the input parameters for the test case.
* The "out" object contains the expected output for the test case.

In this case, the input parameters are the "brackets" string, and the expected output is a boolean indicating whether the brackets are balanced or not.</s>  ```
def is_balanced_brackets(brackets):
    stack = []
    for bracket in brackets:
        if bracket == "(":
            stack.append(bracket)
        elif bracket == ")":
            if len(stack) == 0:
                return False
            stack.pop()
    return len(stack) == 0
```
This code uses a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets. It loops through the input string, and for each opening bracket, it pushes it onto the stack. For each closing bracket, it pops the top element from the stack, if the stack is empty, it means there are more closing brackets than opening brackets, and the string is not balanced. If the stack is not empty after looping through the entire input string, it means there are more opening brackets than closing brackets, and the string is not balanced. The function returns True if the stack is empty, and False otherwise.</s>  ```
def is_balanced(brackets):

    return not stack
```
This code uses a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets and ensures that every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket. It returns True if the stack is empty at the end of the string, indicating that all opening brackets have been closed.</s>  ```

            if not stack:
                return False
            stack.pop()
    return not stack
```</s>  Here's a possible solution using a stack data structure:
```
def is_balanced(brackets):
    stack = []
    for bracket in brackets:
        if bracket == "(":
            stack.append(bracket)
        elif bracket == ")":
            if not stack:
                return False
            stack.pop()
    return not stack
```
Explanation:

1. Initialize a stack `stack = []`.
2. Iterate over each bracket in the input string `brackets`.
3. If the bracket is an opening bracket, push it onto the stack.
4. If the bracket is a closing bracket, pop the top item from the stack and check if it is a matching opening bracket. If there are no items in the stack, return `False`.
5. Once you have iterated over all the brackets, check if the stack is empty. If it is, return `True`. Otherwise, return `False`.

Note that this solution assumes that the input string only contains "(" and ")". If the input string can contain other characters, you may need to modify the code accordingly.</s>  ```

This code uses a stack to keep track of the opening brackets, and checks that every closing bracket has a corresponding opening bracket. If any closing bracket does not have a corresponding opening bracket, the stack will not be empty at the end, and the function will return False. Otherwise, the function will return True.</s>  ```

```
This code uses a stack to keep track of the opening brackets and checks if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket. If a closing bracket is found without a matching opening bracket, the function returns False. Otherwise, the function returns True if all opening brackets have a corresponding closing bracket.</s>  ```

This code uses a stack to keep track of the opening brackets. It iterates through the string and checks if every closing bracket has a corresponding opening bracket. If a closing bracket is encountered without a corresponding opening bracket, the function returns False. If all closing brackets have a corresponding opening bracket, the function returns True.</s>  ```

            if not stack:
                return False
            stack.pop()
    return not stack
```
This code uses a stack to keep track of the opening brackets. When it encounters a closing bracket, it checks if the stack is empty. If it is, it means that there is an extra closing bracket, and the string is not balanced. If it is not, it means that there is a corresponding opening bracket, and the stack is popped. If the stack is empty at the end of the loop, it means that all opening brackets have a corresponding closing bracket, and the string is balanced.</s>
