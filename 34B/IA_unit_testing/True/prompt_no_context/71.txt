Prompt: 
    Given the lengths of the three sides of a triangle. Return the area of
    the triangle rounded to 2 decimal points if the three sides form a valid triangle. 
    Otherwise return -1
    Three sides make a valid triangle when the sum of any two sides is greater 
    than the third side.
    Example:
    triangle_area(3, 4, 5) == 6.00
    triangle_area(1, 2, 10) == -1

This test suite includes four test cases for the `triangle_area` function. Each test case specifies the input values for the three sides of a triangle, and the expected output for each case is provided. The test cases cover a variety of scenarios, including valid triangles (where the sum of any two sides is greater than the third side) and invalid triangles (where the sum of any two sides is less than or equal to the third side).</s>

Here's an explanation of the code:

1. The `triangle_area` function takes three arguments - the lengths of the three sides of a triangle.
2. The function first checks if the three sides form a valid triangle by calling the `is_valid_triangle` function.
3. If the triangle is valid, the function calculates the area of the triangle using the formula `area = (side1 + side2 + side3) / 2`.
4. The area is then rounded to 2 decimal points using the `round` function.
5. If the triangle is not valid, the function returns -1.
6. The `is_valid_triangle` function checks if the sum of any two sides is greater than the third side. If the condition is met, the triangle is valid.

Note that this code uses the `round` function to round the area to 2 decimal points. If you want to round to a different number of decimal points, you can change the second argument of the `round` function accordingly.</s>
