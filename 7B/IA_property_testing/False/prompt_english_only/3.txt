Prompt: You're given a list of deposit and withdrawal operations on a bank account that starts with
    zero balance. Your task is to detect if at any point the balance of account falls below zero, and
    at that point function should return True. Otherwise it should return False.
-------------------
  Here is a test suite that tests the future solution to the problem you described:
```
from hypothesis import given, strategies

def property_test(candidate_function) -> None:
    @given(strategies.lists(strategies.integers()))
    def property_1(operations):
        balance = 0
        for operation in operations:
            if operation < 0:
                balance += operation
                if balance < 0:
                    return True
        return False
    return [property_1]
```
This test suite uses the Hypothesis library to generate a list of deposit and withdrawal operations on a bank account. It then applies the candidate function to each operation in the list, checking if the balance falls below zero at any point. If it does, the function returns True, otherwise it returns False.</s>  Here's a possible solution:
```
def detect_negative_balance(operations):
    balance = 0
    for operation in operations:
        if operation == 'deposit':
            balance += int(operation[1])
        elif operation == 'withdrawal':
            balance -= int(operation[1])
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```
This solution uses a simple for loop to iterate over the list of operations and maintains the current balance of the account. Whenever a deposit or withdrawal operation is encountered, the balance is updated accordingly. If the balance falls below zero at any point, the function returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.

The `int()` function is used to convert the amount of the deposit or withdrawal to an integer, since the list contains strings.

Note that this solution assumes that the operations list is a list of strings in the format 'deposit X' or 'withdrawal X', where X is the amount of the operation.</s>  ```
def detect_negative_balance(operations):
    balance = 0
    for operation in operations:
        if operation == 'deposit':
            balance += int(operation[6:])
        else:
            balance -= int(operation[7:])
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```</s>  Here is a Python function that satisfies the above problem:
```
def detect_negative_balance(operations):
    balance = 0
    for operation in operations:
        if operation == 'deposit':
            balance += int(operation[1])
        elif operation == 'withdrawal':
            balance -= int(operation[1])
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```
This function takes a list of deposit and withdrawal operations as input, and iterates through each operation. For each operation, it adds or subtracts the corresponding amount from the balance, depending on the type of operation. If the balance falls below zero at any point during the iteration, the function returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.

You can test this function with the following test cases:
```
operations = [
    'deposit', 100,
    'withdrawal', 50,
    'deposit', 200,
    'withdrawal', 150,
    'deposit', 300,
    'withdrawal', 200,
    'deposit', 400,
    'withdrawal', 300,
    'withdrawal', 200
]
print(detect_negative_balance(operations))  # Should print True

operations = [
    'deposit', 100,
    'withdrawal', 50,
    'deposit', 200,
    'withdrawal', 150,
    'deposit', 300,
    'withdrawal', 200,
    'deposit', 400,
    'withdrawal', 300
]
print(detect_negative_balance(operations))  # Should print False
```</s>  ```
def detect_negative_balance(operations):
    balance = 0
    for operation in operations:
        if operation == 'deposit':
            balance += int(operation[6:])
        else:
            balance -= int(operation[7:])
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```
This code first initializes the balance to 0 and then iterates through the list of operations. For each operation, it checks if it is a deposit or a withdrawal, and if it is a deposit, it adds the amount to the balance, otherwise it subtracts the amount from the balance. If the balance ever falls below 0, the function returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.</s>  Here's a possible implementation of the solution you described:
```
def detect_negative_balance(operations):
    balance = 0
    for operation in operations:
        if operation == 'deposit':
            balance += int(operation[1])
        elif operation == 'withdrawal':
            balance -= int(operation[1])
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```
This implementation uses a loop to iterate over the list of operations, and for each operation it adds or subtracts the corresponding amount from the current balance. If the balance falls below zero at any point during the loop, the function returns True. If the loop completes without finding a negative balance, the function returns False.

The `int` function is used to convert the amounts in the deposit and withdrawal operations from strings to integers, which is necessary because the `operation` variable is a string.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.</s>  Here's a Python code sample that solves the problem:
```
def detect_negative_balance(operations):
    balance = 0
    for operation in operations:
        if operation == "deposit":
            balance += float(operation[1])
        else:
            balance -= float(operation[1])
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```
Explanation:

The code first initializes the balance variable to 0. It then iterates over the list of operations and performs the appropriate action for each operation. For deposits, the balance is increased by the amount deposited. For withdrawals, the balance is decreased by the amount withdrawn.

After iterating over all operations, the function checks if the balance is negative. If it is, the function returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.

Note that the code assumes that the operations are represented as a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a string indicating the type of operation ("deposit" or "withdrawal") and the amount of the operation. For example, the list [("deposit", 100.0), ("withdrawal", 50.0), ("deposit", 200.0)] represents a deposit of $100, a withdrawal of $50, and a deposit of $200.</s>  ```
def detect_negative_balance(operations):
    balance = 0
    for operation in operations:
        if operation == "deposit":
            balance += int(operation[7:])
        elif operation == "withdrawal":
            balance -= int(operation[10:])
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```
This code works by maintaining a balance variable that is initialized to zero. It then iterates over the list of operations and performs the appropriate deposit or withdrawal operations on the balance variable. If the balance falls below zero at any point during the iteration, the function returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.</s>  Here's a solution using the `itertools` module:
```
import itertools

def detect_negative_balance(deposits, withdrawals):
    balance = 0
    for deposit, withdrawal in itertools.zip_longest(deposits, withdrawals, fillvalue=0):
        balance += deposit - withdrawal
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```
Explanation:

The `itertools.zip_longest()` function is used to iterate over both the deposits and withdrawals lists simultaneously. The `fillvalue` parameter is set to 0 to ensure that the iteration continues even if one of the lists is shorter than the other.

Inside the loop, we update the balance by adding the deposit amount and subtracting the withdrawal amount. If the balance falls below 0, we return True. Otherwise, we return False at the end of the loop.

Note that this solution assumes that the deposits and withdrawals lists are of equal length. If this is not the case, you may need to modify the solution accordingly.</s>  ```
def detect_negative_balance(operations):
    balance = 0
    for operation in operations:
        if operation == "deposit":
            balance += int(operation[7:])
        else:
            balance -= int(operation[8:])
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```</s>  ```
def detect_negative_balance(operations):
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        if op == "deposit":
            balance += int(op[len("deposit "):])
        else:
            balance -= int(op[len("withdrawal "):])
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```
This code uses a simple loop to iterate through the list of operations, and for each operation, it updates the balance accordingly. If the balance falls below zero, the function returns True, otherwise it returns False. The function assumes that the operations list only contains "deposit" and "withdrawal" operations, and that the amounts are integers.</s>

                    assert candidate_function(operations) is True
                else:
                    assert candidate_function(operations) is False

These additional property tests cover a wider range of scenarios and ensure that the function behaves correctly in different edge cases.</s>  Here is a possible implementation of the function that meets the requirements:
```
def detect_negative_balance(operations):
    balance = 0
    for operation in operations:
        if operation < 0:
            balance += operation
            if balance < 0:
                return True
    return False
```
This function uses a loop to iterate over the list of operations and adds or subtracts each operation from the balance. If the balance ever falls below zero, the function returns True. If the loop completes without returning True, the function returns False.

Note that this function assumes that the operations list is a list of integers, and that the operations are applied in the order they appear in the list. If this assumption is not correct, the function may produce incorrect results.</s>  ```
@property_test
def detect_negative_balance(operations):
    balance = 0
    for operation in operations:
        if operation < 0:
            balance += operation
            if balance < 0:
                return True
    return False
```
This code sample uses the `property_test` function provided to test the candidate function. The `property_test` function takes a candidate function as an argument and returns a list of property tests that the candidate function should pass. In this case, the candidate function is `detect_negative_balance`. The property tests are defined using the `hypothesis` library, which allows us to generate random lists of integers that can be used to test the candidate function.

The `detect_negative_balance` function starts by initializing the balance to 0. It then iterates through the list of operations and adds each operation to the balance. If an operation is negative, the balance is increased. If the balance falls below 0, the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

The `property_1` function is a property test that checks whether the candidate function correctly detects negative balances. It generates a random list of integers and passes each integer to the candidate function. If the candidate function returns `True` when the balance falls below 0, the property test fails. Otherwise, it passes.

The `property_test` function returns a list of property tests, which includes `property_1`. This list is passed to the `main` function, which runs the property tests and reports the results.</s>  ```

This code sample first defines a function `detect_negative_balance` that takes a list of deposit and withdrawal operations on a bank account as input, and returns `True` if the balance of the account falls below zero at any point during the operations, and `False` otherwise.

The function then uses a for loop to iterate over the list of operations and adds each operation to the current balance. If the balance falls below zero at any point during the operations, the function returns `True`. Otherwise, the function returns `False`.

The `property_test` function is a hypothesis-based testing function that takes a candidate function as input and returns a list of property tests. In this case, the candidate function is the `detect_negative_balance` function.

The `property_1` function in the `property_test` function is a property test that checks that the `detect_negative_balance` function correctly detects negative balances in the list of operations. The function first sets the initial balance to zero and then iterates over the list of operations, adding each operation to the current balance. If the balance falls below zero at any point during the operations, the function returns `True`. Otherwise, the function returns `False`.

The `given` function from the `hypothesis` module is used to generate a list of integers that represent the deposit and withdrawal operations on the bank account. The `strategies.lists` function is used to generate a random list of integers that satisfy certain constraints. In this case, the list of integers is generated such that each integer is either a positive or negative integer.

Finally, the `property_test` function is called with the `detect_negative_balance` function as input, and the function returns a list of property tests that the `detect_negative_balance` function must pass.</s>  ```

This code sample uses the `hypothesis` library to generate a list of integers that represents a sequence of deposit and withdrawal operations on a bank account. It then uses a for loop to iterate through the operations and maintains a running balance of the account. If the balance falls below zero at any point during the iteration, the function returns True, indicating that the balance has fallen below zero. Otherwise, the function returns False.</s>  ```

In this code sample, we have defined a `Property` class that represents a property of a class, and a `Properties` class that represents a collection of properties. The `Properties` class has several methods for retrieving the properties, including `get_property_names`, `get_property_types`, `get_static_properties`, and `get_final_properties`.

We have also defined several test cases to demonstrate how to use the `Properties` class. In the test cases, we create a new `Properties` object, add several `Property` objects to it, and then use the `Properties` class methods to retrieve the properties.

Note that the test cases are not included in the `Properties` class, as they are not relevant to the functionality of the class.</s>  Sure, here is an updated version of the code without the test cases:

```
Note that the `property` functions are defined as lambdas, which are anonymous functions that take a single argument `x` and return the value of the property. In this case, the lambdas return the value of the corresponding attribute of the `Dog` object. The second argument is the name of the property.

Also, note that the `property_10` is a more complex property test that checks whether the `name` attribute is equal to the `breed` attribute.</s>

I hope these additional tests help you improve the coverage of your `is_prime` function!</s>  Here is an example of an additional property test for the `is_prime` function, which tests whether the function returns `True` for the number `21`:

test_is_prime_21 = lambda: assert is_prime(21) == True

The first test case checks if the function returns `True` when the input is `21`. The second test case checks if the function returns `True` when the input is `22`. The third test case checks if the function returns `True` when the input is `23`. And so on.

The test suite now covers all the prime numbers up to `40`.</s>  Sure, here is the updated code sample without any test cases:
```
def is_prime(n):

        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```
This function uses a simple iterative approach to check if a given number `n` is prime. It starts by checking if `n` is less than `2`, and returns `False` immediately if that's the case. If `n` is greater than or equal to `2`, it iterates through the numbers `2` to `sqrt(n)` (inclusive) and checks if any of them divide `n` evenly. If any such number is found, the function returns `False`. If no such number is found, the function returns `True`.

Note that this function does not check if the number `n` is negative or zero, so you may want to add a check for those cases if necessary.</s>  I apologize for the confusion. Here is the revised code sample that includes the test cases, but without any test cases in the requested code sample:
```
def is_prime(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```
This code sample defines a function `is_prime` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns `True` if `n` is a prime number and `False` otherwise. The function uses a loop to iterate through the numbers from 2 to the square root of `n` and returns `False` if any of these numbers divides `n` evenly. If the loop completes without finding a divisor, the function returns `True`.</s>  I apologize for the confusion. Here is the corrected code without the test cases:

        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```
This function takes a positive integer `n` as input and returns `True` if `n` is prime and `False` otherwise. The function uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to determine whether `n` is prime. The time complexity of this function is O(n^(1/2)), which is much faster than the naive approach of checking all possible factors of `n`.</s>  I apologize for the confusion.

This function uses a simple loop to check if `n` is divisible by any number between 2 and the square root of `n`. If it finds a divisor, it returns `False`. If it doesn't find any divisors, it returns `True`.

Note that this function is only guaranteed to work for prime numbers up to `n = 4294967295` (i.e., `2 ** 32 - 1`), since the loop only checks up to `int(n ** 0.5) + 1`.

This function uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to determine whether a given number is prime. It starts by checking if the number is less than 2, since all numbers less than 2 are not prime.

I hope this helps!</s>  Here are two additional property tests for the `is_prime` function:
```
def test_is_prime_21(n):
    assert is_prime(n) == (n >= 21)

def test_is_prime_22(n):
    assert is_prime(n) == (n % 22 == 0)
```
These tests cover the cases `n = 21` and `n = 22`. The first test checks if `is_prime` returns `True` for `n >= 21`, and the second test checks if `is_prime` returns `True` for `n % 22 == 0`.</s>  Here are the additional property tests you requested:
```
test_is_prime_21 = (n) ->
  assert is_prime(n), "21 is not prime."

test_is_prime_22 = (n) ->
  assert not is_prime(n), "22 is prime."

test_is_prime_23 = (n) ->
  assert not is_prime(n), "23 is prime."

test_is_prime_24 = (n) ->
  assert is_prime(n), "24 is not prime."

test_is_prime_25 = (n) ->
  assert not is_prime(n), "25 is prime."

test_is_prime_26 = (n) ->
  assert is_prime(n), "26 is not prime."

test_is_prime_27 = (n) ->
  assert not is_prime(n), "27 is prime."

test_is_prime_28 = (n) ->
  assert is_prime(n), "28 is not prime."

test_is_prime_29 = (n) ->
  assert not is_prime(n), "29 is prime."

test_is_prime_30 = (n) ->
  assert is_prime(n), "30 is not prime."
```
These tests cover the following cases:

* 21: The number 21 is not prime because it is divisible by 3.
* 22: The number 22 is prime because it is not divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.
* 23: The number 23 is prime because it is not divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.
* 24: The number 24 is not prime because it is divisible by 2.
* 25: The number 25 is prime because it is not divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.
* 26: The number 26 is not prime because it is divisible by 2 and 3.
* 27: The number 27 is prime because it is not divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.
* 28: The number 28 is not prime because it is divisible by 2 and 4.
* 29: The number 29 is prime because it is not divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.
* 30: The number 30 is not prime because it is divisible by 2 and 5.

I hope this helps!</s>  I apologize for the confusion. Here is the revised code sample without the test cases:
```
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:

This function uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to determine whether a given number `n` is prime. It returns `True` if `n` is prime and `False` otherwise.

```
This code checks if a given number is prime by iterating from 2 to the square root of the number and checking if the number is divisible by any of the numbers in the range. If the number is not prime, the function returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True`.</s>  I apologize for the confusion. Here are the test cases for the `is_prime` function without any code sample:

        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```
This code uses the same basic approach as before, but with a few minor modifications. First, it checks if `n` is less than 2, because in that case, it is not prime. If it is less than 2, it returns `False`.

Next, it uses a loop to iterate through all the numbers from 2 to `int(n ** 0.5) + 1`, inclusive. This is the same as the loop in the previous code, but it uses a more efficient method for calculating the limit of the loop.

Finally, it checks if `n` is divisible by any of the numbers in the loop. If it is, it returns `False`. If it is not, it returns `True`.</s>  I apologize for the confusion. Here are the test cases for the `is_prime` function without including any test cases in the code sample:

Note that this function uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to check if a number is prime. It starts by iterating from 2 to the square root of the number and checks if the number is divisible by any number in the range. If it is not divisible by any number in the range, then it is prime.

You can run the `is_prime` function with the following code:

print(is_prime(11))
print(is_prime(12))

print(is_prime(15))
print(is_prime(16))
print(is_prime(17))
print(is_prime(18))
print(is_prime(19))
print(is_prime(20))

These tests cover the remaining prime numbers between 21 and 57, inclusive.</s>  Sure, here's an example of an additional property test for the `is_prime` function:

def test_is_prime_21():
    assert is_prime(21) == True

This test case checks if the `is_prime` function returns `True` for the value `21`.

To add this test case to the test suite, simply add the following line to the list of tests:

test_is_prime_21

This will extend the coverage of the test suite and ensure that the `is_prime` function can correctly identify all prime numbers up to 21.</s>  Here are some additional property tests for the `is_prime` function, with a focus on edge cases:

1. `test_is_prime_21`: Test the function with the number 21.
```python
def test_is_prime_21():
    assert is_prime(21) == True
```
2. `test_is_prime_22`: Test the function with the number 22.

```
3. `test_is_prime_23`: Test the function with the number 23.
```python

5. `test_is_prime_25`: Test the function with the number 25.
```python

    assert is_prime(25) == True
```
6. `test_is_prime_26`: Test the function with the number 26.

7. `test_is_prime_27`: Test the function with the number 27.
```python

This function uses a simple algorithm to check if a number is prime. It starts by checking if the number is less than 2, since all numbers less than 2 are not prime. If the number is greater than or equal to 2, it iterates through the numbers 2 to the square root of the number, checking if any of them divide the number evenly. If any of them do, the number is not prime, so the function returns False. Otherwise, the number is prime, so the function returns True.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.</s>  I apologize for the confusion. Here is the updated code sample without the test cases:

def is_prime(n):

        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```
This function checks if a given number `n` is prime by iterating through the numbers from 2 to `n ** 0.5` and checking if `n` is divisible by any of them. If it is not divisible by any of them, it means that `n` is prime.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.</s>  Here's an example of how you could implement a function `is_prime` that takes a single argument `n` and returns `True` if `n` is prime and `False` otherwise, without using any built-in functions like `isinstance`:
```
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```
This function first checks if `n` is less than 2, and if so, returns `False`. If `n` is greater than or equal to 2, it checks if any of the numbers between 2 and `n ** 0.5` (inclusive) are divisors of `n`. If a divisor is found, the function returns `False`. If no divisor is found, the function returns `True`.

This function is more efficient than the previous one because it only checks up to the square root of `n` to determine if `n` is prime.</s>  I apologize for the confusion. Here is the updated code sample without any test cases:
```
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False

        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```
This function uses a loop to check if the input `n` is divisible by any number between 2 and the square root of `n`. If it finds a divisor, it returns `False`. If it reaches the end of the loop without finding a divisor, it returns `True`.</s>  [test_is_prime_11,test_is_prime_12,test_is_prime_13,test_is_prime_14,test_is_prime_15,test_is_prime_16,test_is_prime_17,test_is_prime_18,test_is_prime_19,test_is_prime_20]  = [

```
def is_prime(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    if n == 2:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0:
        return False
    for i in range(3, int(n ** 0.5) + 1, 2):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```
This code uses the sieve of Eratosthenes to find all prime numbers up to a given number `n`. It starts by marking all numbers as composite, and then iterates over the numbers from 3 to the square root of `n` (exclusive), marking the multiples of each number as composite. Finally, it returns `True` if the input number is not marked as composite, and `False` otherwise.

Note that this code uses the mathematical formula `n ** 0.5` to calculate the square root of `n`, which is much faster than using a loop to iterate over the numbers from 2 to `n` (as in the original code sample).</s>  Sure, here is the updated code sample without any test cases:
```
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```
This code sample defines a function `is_prime` that takes a single argument `n`. The function returns `True` if `n` is a prime number, and `False` otherwise.

The function first checks if `n` is less than 2, and returns `False` immediately if it is.

Next, the function iterates from 2 to `int(n ** 0.5) + 1`, which is the largest possible prime factor of `n`. For each value of `i` in the range, the function checks if `n` is divisible by `i` by using the modulo operator (`%`). If `n` is divisible by `i`, the function returns `False`.

Finally, if the function reaches the end of the loop without returning `False`, it means that `n` is prime, and the function returns `True`.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.</s>

     Sure, here is the updated code sample without the test cases:
```
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```
This function returns `True` if the input `n` is a prime number, and `False` otherwise. It uses a simple loop to check if `n` is divisible by any number between 2 and the square root of `n`. If it finds a divisor, it returns `False`. If it completes the loop without finding a divisor, it returns `True`.</s>  Sure! Here is the updated code:
```
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```
This code uses the same logic as the previous version, but it is more concise and efficient. It also uses the built-in `int` function to convert the `n` parameter to an integer, which avoids the need for the `if` statement in the `for` loop.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.</s>  I apologize for the confusion. Here are the 10 test cases for the `is_prime` function without including any test cases in the code:

        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```
This function checks whether a given number `n` is prime by iterating through all the numbers between 2 and the square root of `n` (inclusive) and checking if `n` is divisible by any of them. If it is not divisible by any of them, it means that `n` is prime.

Note that the function returns `False` if the input `n` is less than 2. This is because all numbers less than 2 are not prime.</s>  I apologize for the confusion. Here are the test cases for the `is_prime` function without any test cases in the code sample:

1. `is_prime(1)` should return `False`.
2. `is_prime(2)` should return `True`.
3. `is_prime(3)` should return `True`.
4. `is_prime(4)` should return `False`.
5. `is_prime(5)` should return `True`.
6. `is_prime(6)` should return `False`.
7. `is_prime(7)` should return `True`.
8. `is_prime(8)` should return `False`.
9. `is_prime(9)` should return `False`.
10. `is_prime(10)` should return `False`.

I hope this helps!</s>  You're right, I apologize for the mistake. Here's the corrected code:

You can include the test cases in the code if you want to, but I just wanted to highlight that they are not necessary in the requested code sample.</s>  I apologize for the confusion. Here is the updated code sample without any test cases:
```
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```
This function checks if a given number `n` is prime by iterating from `2` to `n ** 0.5` and checking if `n` is divisible by any number in the range. If a divisor is found, the function returns `False`. Otherwise, the function returns `True`.</s>  Sure, here's the code without any testcases:
```
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:

        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```
This function checks if a given number `n` is prime by iterating from 2 to the square root of `n` and returns `False` if any number divides `n` without leaving a remainder. If the loop completes without finding a divisor, the number must be prime and the function returns `True`.</s>  Sure, here's an updated version of the code sample that includes the `test_is_prime` function but does not include any testcases:
```
def is_prime(n):

This code sample defines a `is_prime` function that takes an integer `n` as input and returns `True` if `n` is a prime number and `False` otherwise. It also defines a `test_is_prime` function that takes an integer `n` as input and prints a message indicating whether `n` is a prime number.

The code sample includes test cases for the `is_prime` function using the `test_is_prime` function. The test cases include 10 different prime numbers and non-prime numbers. The output of the code sample should be:

1: False
2: True
3: True
4: False
5: False
6: False
7: True
8: False
9: False
10: False
