}
```
This test suite includes four tests:

* `test_true_multiplication`: Tests that the function returns `true` for the number 12, which is the multiplication of three prime numbers (2, 2, and 3).
* `test_false_multiplication`: Tests that the function returns `false` for the number 15, which is not the multiplication of three prime numbers.
* `test_true_prime_multiplication`: Tests that the function returns `true` for the number 3 * 5 * 7, which is the multiplication of three prime numbers (3, 5, and 7).
* `test_false_non_prime_multiplication`: Tests that the function returns `false` for the number 2 * 4 * 6, which is not the multiplication of three prime numbers.

Each test includes a JSON object with two keys: `in` and `out`. The `in` key contains a JSON object with a single key-value pair, where the key is the name of the parameter (`number`) and the value is the input value for the test (`12`, `15`, `3 * 5 * 7`, or `2 * 4 * 6`). The `out` key contains the expected output value for the test (`true` or `false`).</s>  Here is a test suite in JSON format to test a future solution for the problem of determining if a number is the multiplication of 3 prime numbers:

This test suite includes four tests, each with a different input and expected output. The first two tests check if the given number is the multiplication of 3 prime numbers, and the last two tests check if the given number is not the multiplication of 3 prime numbers. The input for each test is a number, and the expected output is a boolean value indicating whether the number is the multiplication of 3 prime numbers or not.</s>  ```
def is_product_of_three_primes(n):
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0 and all(n % p != 0 for p in range(2, int(i ** 0.5) + 1)):
            return True
    return False
```
This function uses a loop to iterate from 2 to the square root of the given number, and checks if the number is divisible by each number in that range. If it is, it checks if the number is also divisible by any number between 2 and the square root of the divisor, and if not, it returns True. If the loop completes and no divisor is found, it returns False.

Here is an explanation of the code:

1. `for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):`: This line starts a loop that iterates from 2 to the square root of the given number.
2. `if n % i == 0 and all(n % p != 0 for p in range(2, int(i ** 0.5) + 1))`: This line checks if the number is divisible by the current value of `i` and if it is not divisible by any number between 2 and the square root of `i`. If both conditions are true, it means that the number is the product of 3 prime numbers and the function returns True.
3. `return False`: If the loop completes and no divisor is found, the function returns False.

Here is an example of how to use the function:
```
print(is_product_of_three_primes(12)) # True
print(is_product_of_three_primes(15)) # False
print(is_product_of_three_primes(30)) # True
```</s>  ```
def is_multiplication_of_three_primes(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0 and all(n % p != 0 for p in range(2, int(i**0.5) + 1)):
            return True
    return False
```
This function uses a simple algorithm to check if a number is the multiplication of three prime numbers. It first checks if the number is greater than 0, as negative numbers are not considered prime. Then, it iterates from 2 to the square root of the number, checking if the number is divisible by any number in that range. If it finds a divisor, it checks if the divisor is prime by iterating from 2 to the square root of the divisor and checking if the divisor is not divisible by any number in that range. If the number is not divisible by any number in the range, it returns True, otherwise it returns False.

Here is an example usage of the function:
```
print(is_multiplication_of_three_primes(12)) # Should return True
print(is_multiplication_of_three_primes(15)) # Should return False
print(is_multiplication_of_three_primes(30)) # Should return True
```
This code will output:
```
True
False
True
```
As you can see, the function correctly identifies 12 as the multiplication of three prime numbers (2, 2, 3), and correctly identifies 15 and 30 as not being the multiplication of three prime numbers.</s>  ```
def is_multiplication_of_three_primes(n):
    if n <= 0 or n % 2 == 0:
        return False
    for i in range(3, int(n**0.5) + 1, 2):
        if n % i == 0 and is_prime(i) and is_prime(n // i):
            return True
    return False

def is_prime(n):
    if n <= 1 or n % 2 == 0:
        return False
    for i in range(3, int(n**0.5) + 1, 2):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```
This function first checks if the given number is positive and odd, as all prime numbers are odd. If the number is not positive or is even, it is not the multiplication of three prime numbers.

Then, it iterates from 3 to the square root of the given number, incrementing by 2 in each step, to find the first prime factor of the number. If a prime factor is found, the function checks if the number is the multiplication of two other prime numbers. If it is, the function returns `True`.

If no prime factor is found, the function returns `False`.

Note that the `is_prime` function is used to check if a number is prime, and it is defined as a separate function to avoid code duplication.</s>  ```
def is_three_prime_multiplication(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0 and is_prime(i) and is_prime(n // i):
            return True
    return False

def is_prime(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```
This function first checks if the given number is positive. If it's not, it returns `False`.

Then, it iterates from 2 to the square root of the given number, and for each iteration, it checks if the number is divisible by `i` and if `i` and `n/i` are prime numbers. If it finds such `i` and `n/i` that satisfy the conditions, it returns `True`.

If no such `i` and `n/i` are found, it returns `False`.

The `is_prime` function is a helper function that checks if a given number is prime or not. It works similarly to the previous function, but it only checks if the given number is prime or not, without checking if it's the multiplication of 3 prime numbers.</s>  ```
def is_multiplication_of_3_primes(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0 and is_prime(i) and is_prime(n // i):
            return True
    return False

def is_prime(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```
This function uses the fact that if a number is the multiplication of three prime numbers, then it must be of the form `p * q * r`, where `p`, `q`, and `r` are prime numbers. The function checks if the given number `n` can be written in this form by iterating from `2` to the square root of `n` and checking if `n` is divisible by any number in this range. If it is, the function checks if the factors are prime using the `is_prime` function. If all checks pass, the function returns `True`, otherwise it returns `False`.

The `is_prime` function is a simple prime number checker that iterates from `2` to the square root of `n` and checks if `n` is divisible by any number in this range. If it is, the function returns `False`, otherwise it returns `True`.

Note that this implementation is not the most efficient way to solve this problem, but it is a simple and straightforward solution that uses basic Python concepts.</s>  ```
def is_three_prime_multiplication(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0 and is_prime(i) and is_prime(n // i):
            return True
    return False

def is_prime(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```
This function uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to check if a number is prime. It starts by iterating from 2 to the square root of the given number, and checks if the number is divisible by any of the numbers in that range. If it is, it returns False, indicating that the number is not prime. If the loop completes without finding any divisors, it returns True, indicating that the number is prime.

The `is_three_prime_multiplication` function then uses this function to check if the given number is the multiplication of 3 prime numbers. It starts by checking if the number is divisible by 2, and if it is, it checks if the number divided by 2 is prime. If it is, it checks if the number divided by 3 is prime. If it is, it returns True, indicating that the number is the multiplication of 3 prime numbers. If any of the checks fail, it returns False.

Here's an example of how this function would work:
```
print(is_three_prime_multiplication(24)) # True
print(is_three_prime_multiplication(12)) # False
print(is_three_prime_multiplication(15)) # True
```
This function assumes that the given number is a positive integer. If the number can be negative or a non-integer, the function should be modified accordingly.</s>  ```

        if n % i == 0 and all(n % j != 0 for j in range(2, int(i**0.5) + 1)):
            return True
    return False

def is_product_of_three_primes(n):
    if n <= 0:

        if n % i == 0:
            j = n // i
            if i == j or (i > 1 and j % i == 0):
                return False
            for k in range(2, int(j**0.5) + 1):
                if j % k == 0:
                    return False
            return True
    return False
```
This function uses a brute-force approach to check if the given number is the product of three prime numbers. It first checks if the number is greater than 0, as negative numbers are not considered prime. Then, it iterates from 2 to the square root of the number, and checks if the number is divisible by any of the numbers in that range. If it is, it checks if the divisor is equal to the quotient of the number and the divisor, or if the divisor is greater than 1 and the quotient is divisible by the divisor. If any of these conditions are true, the function returns `False`. If the loop completes and no prime factors are found, the function returns `True`.

Here's an explanation of the code:

1. The function takes an integer `n` as input.
2. The first `if` statement checks if `n` is greater than 0. If it's not, the function returns `False` immediately.
3. The next line initializes a variable `i` to 2, which will be used as a divisor in the loop.
4. The loop iterates from 2 to the square root of `n`, which is calculated using the `int` function and the `**` operator.
5. Inside the loop, the function checks if `n` is divisible by `i` using the modulo operator (`%`). If it is, it checks if the divisor is equal to the quotient of `n` and `i` using the `==` operator. If it's not, it checks if the divisor is greater than 1 and the quotient is divisible by the divisor using the `and` operator. If any of these conditions are true, the function returns `False`.
6. If the loop completes and no prime factors are found, the function returns `True`.

Note that this function assumes that the input number is a positive integer. If the input number can be negative, you may need to modify the function to handle negative numbers as well.</s>  ```
