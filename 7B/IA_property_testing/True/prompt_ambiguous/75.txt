```
This test suite uses the Hypothesis library to generate test cases for the `candidate_function`. The `property_1` and `property_2` functions are decorated with the `@given` decorator and define two property tests. The `property_1` function tests the correctness of the candidate function by checking if the input number is the multiplication of 3 prime numbers. The `property_2` function tests the input number is a non-negative integer. The test suite returns a list of property tests that can be used to test the candidate function.</s>  To solve this problem, we can use the `math.gcd` function to find the greatest common divisor of three numbers. If the greatest common divisor is 1, then the numbers are coprime and can be used as the prime factors of the given number.

Here's an example Python code that solves the problem:
```
import math

def is_multiple_of_three_primes(n):
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            j = n // i
            k = i * j
            if k == n:
                return True
    return False
```
This code checks if the given number `n` is the multiplication of three prime numbers by dividing it by the largest prime factor. If the number is divisible by two prime factors, it must be the multiplication of three prime numbers.

For example, the number 36 is the multiplication of three prime numbers (3, 4, and 6) because 36 = 3 \* 4 \* 6.

The function `is_multiple_of_three_primes` takes a single argument `n`, which is the number to be checked. It returns a boolean value indicating whether the number is the multiplication of three prime numbers.</s>  ```
def is_multiple_of_three_prime_numbers(n):
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            j = n // i
            if j == 1 or j == i:
                return False
            for k in range(2, int(j ** 0.5) + 1):
                if j % k == 0:
                    return False
            return True
    return False
```
Explanation:

The problem is to check if a given number `n` is the product of three prime numbers. We can solve this problem by trying all possible combinations of three prime numbers and checking if the product is equal to `n`.

The algorithm starts by iterating from 2 to the square root of `n`. For each prime number `i`, we check if `n` is divisible by `i`. If it is, we divide `n` by `i` and check if the result is a prime number. If it is, we repeat the process with the new number until we find three prime numbers that multiply to `n`.

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n^(1/2)), where n is the number we are trying to factor. The space complexity is O(1) since we only need to store the current prime number and the result of dividing `n` by the current prime number.</s>  ```
def is_multiple_of_3_prime_numbers(n):
    # Check if the number is divisible by 3
    if n % 3 != 0:
        return False

    # Find the cube root of the number
    cube_root = n ** (1/3)

    # Check if the cube root is an integer
    if cube_root != int(cube_root):
        return False

    # Check if the number is the product of 3 prime numbers
    prime_factors = []
    for i in range(3, int(cube_root) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            prime_factors.append(i)
            if len(prime_factors) == 3:
                return True

    return False
```
This code first checks if the number is divisible by 3, if it is not, it returns False.

Then, it finds the cube root of the number, if the cube root is not an integer, it returns False.

Next, it checks if the number is the product of 3 prime numbers, if it is not, it returns False.

Finally, it returns True if the number is the product of 3 prime numbers.

Note that this code uses the `math.cbrt()` function to find the cube root of a number, and the `math.isqrt()` function to check if a number is a perfect square.</s>  To check if a given number is the multiplication of 3 prime numbers, you can use the following Python code:
```
def is_multiple_of_three_prime_numbers(n):
    if n <= 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0 and is_prime(i) and is_prime(n // i):
            return True
    return False

def is_prime(n):
    if n <= 1 or n % 2 == 0:
        return False
    for i in range(3, int(n ** 0.5) + 1, 2):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```
Explanation:

The function `is_multiple_of_three_prime_numbers(n)` takes an integer `n` as input and returns a boolean indicating whether `n` is the multiplication of 3 prime numbers.

The function first checks if `n` is less than or equal to 2, and if so, returns `False`.

Next, it iterates over the numbers from 2 to the square root of `n`, and checks if `n` is divisible by any of these numbers. If it finds a pair of prime numbers, it returns `True`.

The function `is_prime(n)` takes an integer `n` as input and returns a boolean indicating whether `n` is prime.

The function first checks if `n` is less than or equal to 1 or divisible by 2. If so, it returns `False`.

Next, it iterates over the numbers from 3 to the square root of `n`, and checks if `n` is divisible by any of these numbers. If it finds a prime number, it returns `False`.

Finally, if the function reaches the end of the loop without finding a prime number, it returns `True`.

Note that the function `is_prime(n)` is a separate function that checks whether a given number is prime. You can use this function in the `is_multiple_of_three_prime_numbers(n)` function to check if a number is prime.</s>  Sure, here's a Python code that checks if a given number is the multiplication of 3 prime numbers:
```
def is_prime_multiplication(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```
This code uses the fact that if a number is the multiplication of 3 prime numbers, it must have at least 3 prime factors. It iterates through the range of numbers from 2 to the square root of n (since the largest prime factor of n must be less than or equal to the square root of n) and checks if n is divisible by each number. If any number divides n, it returns False. Otherwise, it returns True.

Here's an example usage:
```
print(is_prime_multiplication(12))  # Output: True
print(is_prime_multiplication(14))  # Output: False
```
Note that this code uses the `math.sqrt()` function from the `math` module, which calculates the square root of a number. If you don't want to use this function, you can replace it with `int(n ** 0.5)` to calculate the square root of n.</s>  ```
def is_multiple_of_three_primes(n):
    if n == 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```
This code uses the fact that if a number is the product of three prime numbers, it must be of the form $pqr$, where $p$, $q$, and $r$ are distinct prime numbers. It then checks if the number is the product of three prime numbers by iterating over the factors of the number and checking if any of them are prime. If no prime factors are found, the number is not the product of three prime numbers.

Note that this code assumes that the input number is a positive integer. If the input number is a negative integer, you may need to modify the code to handle the case where the number is negative.</s>  To check if a given number is the multiplication of 3 prime numbers, we can use the following algorithm:

1. Factor the number into its prime factors using the `factor()` function from the `math` module.
2. Check if the number of prime factors is equal to 3. If it is, then the number is the multiplication of 3 prime numbers.
3. If the number of prime factors is not equal to 3, then the number is not the multiplication of 3 prime numbers.

Here is an example code snippet that implements this algorithm:
```
from math import factor

def is_multiple_of_three_primes(n):
    prime_factors = factor(n)
    if len(prime_factors) == 3:
        return True
    else:
        return False
```
Note that this code uses the `factor()` function from the `math` module to factor the given number into its prime factors. The `len()` function is used to determine the number of prime factors, and the `==` operator is used to compare the number of prime factors to 3.</s>  Here is a Python function that checks if a given number is the multiplication of 3 prime numbers:
```
def is_prime_product(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```
This function uses a simple algorithm to check if a given number is the multiplication of 3 prime numbers. It first checks if the number is 1 or less, since 1 is not the multiplication of any prime numbers. Then, it iterates through the numbers from 2 to the square root of the number, checking if any of them divide the number evenly. If the number is not divisible by any of these numbers, it is not the multiplication of 3 prime numbers.

For example, the number 60 is the multiplication of 3 prime numbers: 2, 3, and 5. The function would return True for this input.

The function also returns False for non-prime numbers, such as 42, since it is not the multiplication of 3 prime numbers.
```
is_prime_product(42)  # returns False
is_prime_product(60)  # returns True
```
This function uses the math module to calculate the square root of the number, which is necessary for the algorithm to work. The import statement is therefore:
```
from math import sqrt
```</s>  To check if a given number is the multiplication of 3 prime numbers, you can use the following code:
```
def is_product_of_three_primes(n):
    for p in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % p == 0 and is_prime(p):
            for q in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
                if n % q == 0 and is_prime(q):
                    return True
    return False

def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```
This code uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to find all prime numbers up to the square root of the given number, and then checks if the number is the product of two of these prime numbers. The `is_prime` function is a helper function that checks if a number is prime.

You can test this code with the following test cases:
```
print(is_product_of_three_primes(12))  # should print True
print(is_product_of_three_primes(15))  # should print False
print(is_product_of_three_primes(100))  # should print True
```</s>  To check if a given number is the multiplication of 3 prime numbers, we can use the following approach:

1. Factor the given number into its prime factors.
2. Check if each prime factor is a prime number.
3. If all prime factors are prime numbers, then the given number is the multiplication of 3 prime numbers.

Here's the Python code to solve this problem:
```python
def is_multiple_of_three_prime_numbers(n):
    prime_factors = []
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            prime_factors.append(i)
    for prime_factor in prime_factors:
        if not is_prime(prime_factor):
            return False
    return True

def is_prime(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```
In the first function, we iterate over the prime factors of the given number `n` and check if each prime factor is a prime number. If all prime factors are prime numbers, then the given number is the multiplication of 3 prime numbers.

In the second function, we use the Sieve of Eratosthenes to find all prime numbers up to the square root of the given number `n`.

Note that this approach is not the most efficient way to solve this problem, as it involves factoring the given number and checking if each prime factor is a prime number. A more efficient approach would be to use a combination of modular arithmetic and number theory to determine if the given number is the multiplication of 3 prime numbers.</s>

This test suite uses the Hypothesis library to generate a set of inputs (integers) and checks if the candidate function returns the correct output for each input. The first property test checks if the candidate function correctly identifies when a number is not the multiplication of 3 prime numbers, while the second property test checks if the candidate function correctly identifies when a number is the multiplication of 3 prime numbers.</s>  Here's a Python function that takes a number as input and returns True if it's the product of three prime numbers, and False otherwise:
```
def is_product_of_three_primes(n):
    if n < 3:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0 and is_prime(i) and is_prime(n // i):
            return True

        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```
This function first checks if the input number is less than 3. If it is, it returns False. Otherwise, it iterates over the range of numbers from 2 to the square root of the input number, and checks if the input number is divisible by any of the numbers in that range. If it is, it checks if the numbers are prime using the is_prime function. If both numbers are prime, it returns True. If it doesn't find any prime factors, it returns False.

This function uses the is_prime function to check if a number is prime, which is a more efficient way to check if a number is prime than using trial division.

Note that this function assumes that the input number is a positive integer. If the input number is negative, you may need to modify the function to handle that case.</s>
