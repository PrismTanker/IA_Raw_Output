Prompt: Swap case of characters in a string.
-------------------
  Here is a test suite for the problem of swapping the case of characters in a string:
```
{
    "test1": {
        "in": {
            "string": "Hello World!"
        },
        "out": "hELLO wORLD!"
    },
    "test2": {
        "in": {
            "string": "Python is cool!"
        },
        "out": "pYTHON IS COOL!"
    },
    "test3": {
        "in": {
            "string": "I love Python!"
        },
        "out": "i LOVE pYTHON!"
    }
}
```
This test suite includes three test cases, each with a different input string and the corresponding expected output. The input strings are of varying length and contain both uppercase and lowercase characters. The expected outputs are the input strings with the case of the characters swapped, as described in the problem statement.</s>  ```
def swap_case(string):
    return string.swapcase()
```

This function takes a string as input and returns a new string with the case of each character swapped. The `swapcase()` method is used to perform the case swapping.

Here are some examples of how the function works:
```
print(swap_case("Hello")) # Output: hELLO
print(swap_case("hello")) # Output: HELLO
print(swap_case("HELLO")) # Output: hello
```
Note that this function only works with ASCII characters. If you need to handle Unicode characters, you may need to use a different approach.</s>  Here's a possible solution:
```
def swap_case(s):
    return s.swapcase()
```
Here's an explanation of the code:

* The `swapcase()` method is called on the input string `s`. This method returns a new string with the case of each character swapped. For example, if the input string is "Hello World", the output string would be "hELLO wORLD".

Here's an example usage of the function:
```
print(swap_case("Hello World")) # Output: hELLO wORLD
```
It's worth noting that this solution uses the built-in `swapcase()` method, which is a convenient way to swap the case of characters in a string. However, if you wanted to implement the function yourself without using any built-in methods, you could use a loop to iterate over each character in the string and swap its case using the `upper()` and `lower()` methods.</s>  ```
def swap_case(string):
    return string.swapcase()
```

This function uses the built-in `swapcase()` method of strings to swap the case of all characters in the input string.

Here's an example of how you can use this function:
```
>>> swap_case("Hello World")
'hELLO wORLD'
```</s>  ```
def swap_case(s):
    return s.swapcase()
```
This code uses the built-in `str.swapcase()` method to swap the case of the characters in the input string.

Here's an example usage:
```
>>> swap_case("Hello World")
'hELLO wORLD'
```</s>  ```
def swap_case(string):
    return string.swapcase()
```

Here's an explanation of how the code works:

* The `swapcase()` method is called on the input string, which returns a new string with the case of each character swapped (i.e., uppercase becomes lowercase and lowercase becomes uppercase).
* The resulting string is returned by the function.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```
print(swap_case("Hello World")) # Output: hELLO wORLD
```</s>  ```
def swap_case(s):
    return s.swapcase()
```
This code uses the built-in `swapcase()` method of strings to swap the case of all characters in the input string.

Here's an example usage:
```
print(swap_case("Hello World")) # prints "hELLO wORLD"
```
This code passes the given test cases:
```
print(swap_case("hello world")) # prints "HELLO WORLD"
print(swap_case("")) # prints ""
print(swap_case("12345")) # prints "12345"
```</s>  ```
def swap_case(s):
    return s.swapcase()
```
This function uses the built-in `swapcase()` method of strings in Python to swap the case of each character in the input string.

Here's an example of how you can use this function:
```
print(swap_case("Hello World")) # prints "hELLO wORLD"
```</s>  ```
def swap_case(s):
    return s.swapcase()
```
This code uses the built-in `swapcase()` method of strings in Python to swap the case of all characters in the input string.

Here's an example usage:
```
print(swap_case("Hello World")) # Output: hELLO wORLD
```
This code will work for any string, regardless of the case of its characters.</s>  ```
def swap_case(s):
    return s.swapcase()
```
This function uses the built-in `swapcase()` method of the `str` object to swap the case of all characters in the input string.

Here's an example usage:
```
>>> swap_case("Hello World")
'hELLO wORLD'
```</s>  Here's a possible solution:
```
def swap_case(s):
    return s.swapcase()
```
Here's an explanation of how the code works:

* The `swapcase()` method is called on the input string `s`. This method returns a new string with the case of each character inverted (i.e., uppercase becomes lowercase and lowercase becomes uppercase).
* The return value of the `swapcase()` method is assigned to a new variable `s`. This variable is then returned by the function.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```
>>> swap_case("Hello, World!")
"hELLO, wORLD!"
```</s>
