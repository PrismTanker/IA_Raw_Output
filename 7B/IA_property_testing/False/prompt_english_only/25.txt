This code uses a simple algorithm to factorize a given number. It starts by iterating through all possible prime factors (starting from 2) and checking if the input number is divisible by each of them. If it is, it appends the factor to the list of factors and divides the input number by it. It continues this process until the input number is reduced to 1, at which point the remaining factor is the only prime factor left.

The function returns a list of prime factors in the order from smallest to largest, with each factor listed the number of times it appears in the factorization.

For example, if the input number is 120, the output would be [2, 2, 2, 3, 5], since 120 can be factored as 2^3 \* 3 \* 5.</s>  ```

This code uses a simple algorithm to find the prime factors of a given integer. It starts with the factor `2` and checks if it divides the input number `n`. If it does, it adds it to the list of factors and divides `n` by the factor. It continues this process with the next factor `i` until it finds a factor that does not divide `n`. If `n` is not a perfect square, it adds the remaining factor to the list. The function returns the list of prime factors in the order from smallest to largest.

For example, if the input is `12`, the output will be `[2, 2, 3]`. If the input is `15`, the output will be `[3, 5]`.</s>  Here is a sample code in Python that returns a list of prime factors of a given integer in the order from smallest to largest, along with the number of times each factor appears in the factorization:
```
def get_prime_factors(n):
    factors = []
    i = 2
    while i * i <= n:
        while n % i == 0:
            factors.append(i)
            n //= i
        i += 1
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)
    return factors
```
This code uses a simple loop to iterate through the prime numbers less than or equal to the square root of the input number. For each prime number, it checks if it divides the input number evenly and if so, it adds the prime number to the list of factors and divides the input number by the prime number. If the input number is not divisible by any prime number, it is added to the list of factors.

For example, if the input number is 120, the code will return the list `[2, 2, 3, 5]`, since 120 can be factored into 2^2 \* 3 \* 5.

If the input number is 10000, the code will return the list `[2, 2, 2, 2, 5, 5]`, since 10000 can be factored into 2^4 \* 5^2.

Note that this code assumes that the input number is a positive integer. If the input number is a negative integer, the code will return the prime factors of the absolute value of the input number. For example, if the input number is -120, the code will return the list `[2, 3, 5]`, since -120 can be factored into 2^2 \* 3 \* 5.</s>  ```

        if n % i:
            i += 1
        else:
            n //= i
            factors.append(i)
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)
    return factors
```
Explanation:

The algorithm starts by setting `i` to 2, which is the smallest prime number. It then iterates through the loop while `i * i` is less than or equal to `n`.

If `n` is not divisible by `i`, the loop continues with `i` incremented by 1.

If `n` is divisible by `i`, the loop continues with `n` divided by `i` and `i` incremented by 1.

The loop continues until `i` is greater than the square root of `n`.

If `n` is not divisible by any prime factors, it is added to the list of prime factors.

The function returns the list of prime factors in the order from smallest to largest.</s>  ```
def get_prime_factors(n):
    factors = []
    while n > 1:
        for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
            while n % i == 0:
                factors.append(i)
                n //= i
    return factors
```
This code uses a simple algorithm to factorize the input number `n` into its prime factors. It starts by setting `n` to the input number and iterates through all the prime factors less than or equal to the square root of `n`. For each prime factor `i`, it checks if `n` is divisible by `i` and if it is, it adds `i` to the list of factors and divides `n` by `i` until it is no longer divisible by `i`. Finally, the function returns the list of prime factors in the order from smallest to largest.

For example, if the input number is 120, the output would be [2, 2, 2, 3, 5]. This means that 120 can be factored into 2^3 \* 3 \* 5.</s>  ```
def get_prime_factors(n):
    factors = []
    i = 2
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i:
            i += 1
        else:
            n //= i
            factors.append(i)
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)
    return factors
```
This code uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to find the prime factors of a given number. It starts by iterating over all possible prime factors starting from 2, and checks if the input number is divisible by each prime factor. If it is, it divides the input number by the prime factor and adds it to the list of prime factors. The algorithm stops when the input number is 1, which means all prime factors have been found.

The `factors` list contains the prime factors of the input number in the order from smallest to largest, and each factor is listed the number of times it appears in the factorization of the input number. For example, if the input number is 12, the output will be `[2, 2, 3]`.

Note that this code assumes that the input number is a positive integer. If the input number is a negative number, the output will be a list of prime factors in the order from largest to smallest. For example, if the input number is -12, the output will be `[-12, 1]`.</s>  ```
def prime_factors(n):
    factors = []
    i = 2
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i:
            i += 1
        else:
            n //= i
            factors.append(i)
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)
    return factors
```
This code uses a simple loop to iterate over all possible prime factors of the input number `n`, and checks if each factor divides `n` evenly. If a factor does divide `n` evenly, it updates the `n` to be the result of the division, and adds the factor to the `factors` list. The loop continues until `n` is reduced to 1, at which point the final prime factor is added to the list. The list is then returned.

Note that this code assumes that the input number is positive, and that the prime factors are in ascending order. If the input number can be negative or if the prime factors are not in ascending order, you may need to modify the code accordingly.</s>  Here's a Python code that solves the problem:
```python
def prime_factors(n):
    factors = []
    i = 2
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i:
            factors.append(i)
            n //= i
        else:
            n //= i
            factors.append(i)
            i += 1
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)
    return factors
```
This code uses a simple algorithm to find the prime factors of a given integer. It starts with the smallest prime number (2) and checks if it divides the input number. If it does, it divides the number and adds the prime factor to the list. If it doesn't, it increments the prime number by 1 and repeats the process until the input number is completely factored.

The function returns a list of prime factors in the order from smallest to largest, with each factor listed the number of times it appears in the factorization.

You can test the function with the following code:
```python
print(prime_factors(12))  # [2, 2, 3]
print(prime_factors(15))  # [3, 5]
print(prime_factors(24))  # [2, 2, 2, 3]
```</s>  Here's a Python code snippet that returns a list of prime factors of a given integer in the order from smallest to largest, with each factor listed the number of times it appears in the factorization:
```
def prime_factors(n):
    factors = []
    while n > 1:
        for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
            while n % i == 0:
                factors.append(i)
                n //= i
    return factors
```
This code uses a while loop to repeatedly divide the input number `n` by the smallest prime factor that divides it until the number becomes 1. The prime factors are stored in a list `factors` and returned at the end of the function.

To test the code, you can use the following test cases:
```
print(prime_factors(12))  # Output: [2, 2, 3]
print(prime_factors(15))  # Output: [3, 5]
print(prime_factors(24))  # Output: [2, 2, 2, 3]
print(prime_factors(100))  # Output: [2, 2, 5, 5]
```
Note that the `**` operator is used to raise a number to a power in Python. In this case, it is used to calculate the square root of the input number.</s>  Here is a function that solves the problem:
```
def prime_factors(n):
    factors = []
    i = 2
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i:
            i += 1
        else:
            count = 0
            while n % i == 0:
                count += 1
                n //= i
            factors.append((i, count))
    if n > 1:
        factors.append((n, 1))
    return factors
```
This function uses a loop to iterate over all possible prime factors of the input number `n`. For each prime factor `i`, it checks if it divides `n` and if it does, it counts the number of times it divides `n` and updates `n` accordingly. If the loop completes without finding any prime factors, it means that the input number `n` is a prime number and the list of prime factors is `[(n, 1)]`.

The function returns a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a prime factor and the number of times it appears in the factorization of `n`. The list is sorted in ascending order of the prime factors.</s>
