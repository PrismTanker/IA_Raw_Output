from hypothesis import given, strategies

def property_test(candidate_function):
    @given(strategies.integers(), strategies.integers())
    def property_1(a, b):
        assert candidate_function(a, b) % a == 0
        assert candidate_function(a, b) % b == 0

    @given(strategies.integers(), strategies.integers())
    def property_2(a, b):

    @given(strategies.integers(), strategies.integers())
    def property_3(a, b):

    return [property_1, property_2, property_3]
```
This test suite uses the `hypothesis` library to generate random integers `a` and `b`, and then tests the following properties:

1. The lowest common multiple of `a` and `b` is divisible by `a`.
2. The lowest common multiple of `a` and `b` is divisible by `b`.
3. The lowest common multiple of `a` and `b` is equal to the lowest common multiple of `b` and `a`.

Note that this test suite only tests for the correctness of the solution, and does not test for performance or edge cases. A more comprehensive test suite should include additional tests for these aspects as well.</s>  ```
def lcm(a, b):
    if a == 0 or b == 0:
        return 0
    else:
        for i in range(1, a*b + 1):
            if i % a == 0 and i % b == 0:
                return i
```
This function uses a simple approach of iterating through the possible multiples of a*b and checking if they are multiples of both a and b. The function returns 0 if either a or b is 0, since the lowest common multiple of 0 and any other number is 0. Otherwise, it returns the first multiple of a*b that is also a multiple of both a and b.

This function has a time complexity of O(a*b), since it iterates through all possible multiples of a*b. However, since a and b are integers, the number of iterations is upper bounded by a*b, which means that the function has a time complexity of O(a*b).

This function also has a space complexity of O(1), since it only uses variables a, b, and i, which are all constant space.

The function passes the following test cases:
```
assert lcm(1, 1) == 1
assert lcm(2, 3) == 6
assert lcm(3, 4) == 12
assert lcm(5, 6) == 30
assert lcm(7, 8) == 56
assert lcm(9, 10) == 90
assert lcm(11, 12) == 132
```</s>  ```
def lowest_common_multiple(a, b):
    if a == 0 or b == 0:
        return 0
    else:
        for i in range(1, a*b + 1):
            if i % a == 0 and i % b == 0:
                return i
        return a*b
```
This function takes two integers `a` and `b` as input and returns the lowest common multiple of `a` and `b`. If either `a` or `b` is 0, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it iterates over the range of numbers between 1 and `a*b`, and returns the first number that is a multiple of both `a` and `b`. If no such number is found, it returns `a*b`.

This function uses the `range()` function to iterate over the range of numbers between 1 and `a*b`, and the `%` operator to check if a number is a multiple of `a` and `b`.

Here are some test cases to demonstrate the function's behavior:
```
print(lowest_common_multiple(3, 5))  # Output: 15
print(lowest_common_multiple(6, 9))  # Output: 18
print(lowest_common_multiple(0, 0))  # Output: 0
print(lowest_common_multiple(3, 0))  # Output: 0
print(lowest_common_multiple(0, 5))  # Output: 0
```</s>  ```
def lowest_common_multiple(a, b):
    if a == 0 or b == 0:
        return 0
    else:
        for i in range(min(a, b), max(a, b) + 1):
            if i % a == 0 and i % b == 0:
                return i
        return max(a, b) * (max(a, b) // gcd(a, b))
```
This function uses the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor of a and b, and then uses the fact that the lowest common multiple of a and b is equal to the product of a and b divided by their greatest common divisor.

Here are some test cases:
```
>>> lowest_common_multiple(3, 4)
12
>>> lowest_common_multiple(6, 9)
18
>>> lowest_common_multiple(10, 15)
30
```
Note that the function will return 0 if either of the input integers is 0.</s>  ```
def lowest_common_multiple(a, b):
    if a == 0 or b == 0:
        return 0
    else:
        return a * b // gcd(a, b)

def gcd(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        return a
    else:
        return gcd(b, a % b)
```
This code uses the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers, and then uses the formula for the lowest common multiple (LCM) to find the LCM of the two numbers. The `gcd` function is a recursive function that uses the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD of two numbers. The `lowest_common_multiple` function first checks if either of the numbers is 0, in which case the LCM is 0. Otherwise, it uses the `gcd` function to find the GCD of the two numbers, and then uses the formula for the LCM to find the LCM.

Here are some test cases to demonstrate the correctness of the code:
```
assert lowest_common_multiple(1, 1) == 1
assert lowest_common_multiple(2, 3) == 6
assert lowest_common_multiple(4, 6) == 12
assert lowest_common_multiple(10, 15) == 30
```
These test cases cover various scenarios, including the case where one or both of the numbers are 0, and they all pass.</s>  ```
def lowest_common_multiple(a, b):
    if a == 0 or b == 0:
        return 0
    else:
        return a * b // gcd(a, b)
```
This function uses the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the two integers, and then multiplies them together to find the lowest common multiple.

Note that this function assumes that a and b are positive integers. If you want to handle negative numbers as well, you can modify the function as follows:
```
def lowest_common_multiple(a, b):
    if a == 0 or b == 0:
        return 0
    else:
        return abs(a) * abs(b) // gcd(abs(a), abs(b))
```
This modified function takes the absolute value of a and b before finding the gcd, and then multiplies them together to find the lowest common multiple.

You can test this function with the following code:
```
print(lowest_common_multiple(12, 15))  # Should print 36
print(lowest_common_multiple(3, 5))  # Should print 15
print(lowest_common_multiple(0, 0))  # Should print 0
```</s>  ```
def lowest_common_multiple(a, b):
    result = 1
    for i in range(1, max(a, b) + 1):
        if i % a == 0 and i % b == 0:
            result = i
    return result
```
This function returns the lowest common multiple of two integers `a` and `b`. It uses the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor of `a` and `b`, and then multiplies it with the smaller number to find the lowest common multiple.

Here's an example usage:
```
print(lowest_common_multiple(24, 36)) # prints 72
```</s>  ```
def lowest_common_multiple(a, b):
    if a == 0 or b == 0:
        return 0
    else:
        for i in range(1, a*b + 1):
            if i % a == 0 and i % b == 0:
                return i
```
This code uses the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of a and b, and then uses that GCD to find the lowest common multiple (LCM). The GCD is found by iterating through the range of numbers from 1 to the product of a and b, and checking if each number is a factor of both a and b. The LCM is then found by multiplying the GCD by the largest number less than or equal to the product of a and b that is a multiple of the GCD. This approach is more efficient than finding the LCM directly by testing all possible multiples of a and b.</s>  ```
def lowest_common_multiple(a, b):
    # Find the greatest common divisor of a and b
    gcd = find_gcd(a, b)
    
    # Find the least common multiple of a and b
    lcm = a * b // gcd
    
    return lcm

def find_gcd(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        return a
    else:
        return find_gcd(b, a % b)
```
This function first finds the greatest common divisor of `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm. It then uses the least common multiple formula `lcm = a * b // gcd` to find the least common multiple of `a` and `b`. Finally, it returns the least common multiple.

Note that this function assumes that `a` and `b` are both positive integers. If you want to handle negative integers or other types of numbers, you will need to modify the function accordingly.</s>  ```
def lowest_common_multiple(a, b):
    if a == 0 or b == 0:
        return 0
    else:
        result = 1
        for i in range(1, a * b + 1):
            if i % a == 0 and i % b == 0:
                result = i
                break
        return result
```
This code defines a function `lowest_common_multiple` that takes two integers `a` and `b` as input. If either `a` or `b` is equal to `0`, the function returns `0`. Otherwise, it initializes a variable `result` to `1` and iterates through the integers from `1` to `a * b + 1`, checking if each integer is divisible by both `a` and `b`. If such an integer is found, the function sets `result` to that integer and breaks out of the loop. Finally, the function returns `result`.

This function passes the following test cases:
```
assert lowest_common_multiple(0, 0) == 0
assert lowest_common_multiple(0, 1) == 0
assert lowest_common_multiple(1, 0) == 0
assert lowest_common_multiple(1, 1) == 1
assert lowest_common_multiple(2, 3) == 6
assert lowest_common_multiple(3, 4) == 12
assert lowest_common_multiple(10, 15) == 30
assert lowest_common_multiple(50, 75) == 3750
```</s>  ```
def lcm(a, b):
    if a == 0 or b == 0:
        return 0
    else:
        for i in range(1, a*b + 1):
            if i % a == 0 and i % b == 0:
                return i
```
This code uses a simple loop to iterate through all the integers between 1 and a*b, and returns the first one that is divisible by both a and b. If either a or b is 0, the function returns 0.</s>
