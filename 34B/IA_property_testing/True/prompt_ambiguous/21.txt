Prompt: Scale a list of numbers to be between 0 and 1.
-------------------
  Sure, here is a test suite using the Hypothesis library to test a future solution for the problem of scaling a list of numbers to be between 0 and 1:
```
from hypothesis import given, strategies

def scale_list(numbers):
    """
    Scale a list of numbers to be between 0 and 1.
    """
    return [number / max(numbers) for number in numbers]

def property_test(candidate_function):
    """
    Property test for the scale_list function.
    """
    @given(strategies.lists(strategies.floats(min_value=0, max_value=1)))
    def test_scale_list(numbers):
        scaled_numbers = candidate_function(numbers)
        assert all(0 <= number <= 1 for number in scaled_numbers)

    return [test_scale_list]
```
This test suite tests the scale_list function by generating a list of random floating point numbers between 0 and 1, and then testing that the function returns a list of numbers that are all between 0 and 1. The test uses the Hypothesis library's `given` function to generate the test data, and the `strategies.lists` and `strategies.floats` functions to generate a list of random floating point numbers. The `max_value` parameter is set to 1 to ensure that the numbers are all between 0 and 1. The test then checks that all of the numbers in the returned list are between 0 and 1 using the `all` function.</s>  ```
def scale_to_0_1(numbers):
    return [(x - min(numbers)) / (max(numbers) - min(numbers)) for x in numbers]
```
This function takes a list of numbers as input, finds the minimum and maximum values in the list, and then scales each number in the list to be between 0 and 1 by subtracting the minimum and dividing by the range (maximum - minimum).

Here's an example usage:
```
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
scaled_numbers = scale_to_0_1(numbers)
print(scaled_numbers)  # [0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0]
```</s>  ```
def scale_list(my_list):
    return [x / max(my_list) for x in my_list]
```
This function takes a list of numbers as input, and returns a new list where each number is scaled to be between 0 and 1. The scaling is done by dividing each number by the maximum value in the input list.

Here's an example usage:
```
>>> scale_list([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
[0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0]
```
Note that this function assumes that the input list is not empty and that the maximum value is not 0. If the input list is empty or if the maximum value is 0, the function will return an empty list.</s>  ```
def scale_list(numbers):
    return [x / max(numbers) for x in numbers]
```
Explanation:

This function takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list where each number is scaled to be between 0 and 1. The scaling is done by dividing each number by the maximum value in the list.

For example, if the input list is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the function will return `[0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5]`.</s>  ```
def scale_list(numbers):
    return [number / max(numbers) for number in numbers]
```
This code uses a list comprehension to scale each number in the input list by dividing it by the maximum value in the list. This ensures that all values are between 0 and 1.

Here's an example usage:
```
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
scaled_numbers = scale_list(numbers)
print(scaled_numbers) # [0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0]
```</s>  ```
def scale_list(my_list):
    return [x / max(my_list) for x in my_list]
```
This function takes a list of numbers as input, and returns a new list where each number is scaled to be between 0 and 1. The scaling is done by dividing each number by the maximum value in the list.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
scaled_list = scale_list(my_list)
print(scaled_list) # [0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0]
```</s>  ```
def scale_list(numbers):
    return [number / max(numbers) for number in numbers]
```
This function takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list where each number is scaled to be between 0 and 1. The function uses a list comprehension to create a new list where each number is divided by the maximum value in the input list. This ensures that the output list has values between 0 and 1.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
scaled_numbers = scale_list(numbers)
print(scaled_numbers)  # [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5]
```</s>  ```
def scale_list(my_list):
    return [i / max(my_list) for i in my_list]
```
This function takes a list of numbers as input, and returns a new list where each element is scaled to be between 0 and 1. The scaling is done by dividing each element by the maximum value in the list.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
scaled_list = scale_list(my_list)
print(scaled_list)  # [0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0]
```</s>  ```
def scale_list(numbers):
    return [(x - min(numbers)) / (max(numbers) - min(numbers)) for x in numbers]
```
This function takes a list of numbers as input, finds the minimum and maximum values in the list, and then scales each number by subtracting the minimum and dividing by the range (maximum minus minimum). This results in a list of numbers between 0 and 1.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
scaled_numbers = scale_list(numbers)
print(scaled_numbers)  # [0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0]
```</s>  ```
def scale_list(numbers):
    return [number / max(numbers) for number in numbers]
```</s>  ```
def scale_list(numbers):
    return [number / max(numbers) for number in numbers]
```
This code uses a list comprehension to scale each number in the input list by dividing it by the maximum value in the list. The resulting list contains the scaled values, which will all be between 0 and 1.

Here's an example usage:
```
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
scaled_numbers = scale_list(numbers)
print(scaled_numbers)  # [0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0]
```
Note that this code assumes that the input list is non-empty and contains only numeric values. If the input list is empty or contains non-numeric values, the code will raise a `ValueError`.</s>

This test suite contains three property tests:

1. `property_1` tests that all elements of the output list are between 0 and 1.
2. `property_2` tests that the length of the input list is equal to the length of the output list.
3. `property_3` tests that the sum of the elements in the input list is equal to the sum of the elements in the output list.

These tests are designed to ensure that the function scales the list of numbers to be between 0 and 1, while preserving the length and sum of the input list.</s>  ```
def scale_to_0_1(numbers):
    return [number / max(numbers) for number in numbers]
```
Explanation:

This function takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list where each number is scaled to be between 0 and 1. The scaling is done by dividing each number by the maximum value in the list. This ensures that the largest number in the list is scaled to 1, and all other numbers are scaled accordingly.

For example, if the input list is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the output list will be `[0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5]`.</s>  ```
def scale_list(my_list):
    return [i / max(my_list) for i in my_list]
```
This function takes a list of numbers as input, finds the maximum value in the list, and then scales each value in the list by dividing it by the maximum value. This will result in a list of numbers between 0 and 1.

For example, if the input list is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the function will return `[0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0]`.</s>  Here's a solution that uses the `numpy` library:
```
import numpy as np

def scale_list(my_list):
    return np.interp(my_list, (my_list.min(), my_list.max()), (0, 1))
```
This function uses the `numpy.interp` function to map the input list to the range [0, 1]. The `numpy.interp` function takes three arguments: the input list, the range of values to map the input list to, and the range of values to map the output list to. In this case, we're mapping the input list to the range [0, 1], so we pass `(0, 1)` as the third argument.

Here's an example usage:
```
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
scaled_list = scale_list(my_list)
print(scaled_list)  # [0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0]
```
Note that the output list will always have the same length as the input list, and the values will be evenly spaced between 0 and 1. If you want to scale the list to a different range, you can simply change the second argument of the `numpy.interp` function. For example, to scale the list to the range [10, 20], you can use the following code:
```
scaled_list = scale_list(my_list, (10, 20))
```</s>  ```
def scale_list(numbers):
    return [number / max(numbers) for number in numbers]
```
This function takes a list of numbers as input, and returns a new list where each number is scaled to be between 0 and 1. The scaling is done by dividing each number by the maximum value in the list.

Here's an example of how to use this function:
```
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
scaled_numbers = scale_list(numbers)
print(scaled_numbers)  # [0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0]
```</s>  Here's a possible solution using the NumPy library:
```
import numpy as np

def scale_list(my_list):
    return np.interp(my_list, (my_list.min(), my_list.max()), (0, 1))
```
This function uses the `np.interp` function to interpolate the input list between the minimum and maximum values of the list, and then scales the result to be between 0 and 1.

Here's an example usage:
```
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
scaled_list = scale_list(my_list)
print(scaled_list)  # [0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0]
```</s>  ```
def scale_list(numbers):
    return [number / max(numbers) for number in numbers]
```
Explanation:

This function takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list where each number is scaled to be between 0 and 1. The function uses a list comprehension to loop through the input list and apply the scaling operation to each number. The `max` function is used to find the maximum value in the input list, which is used to scale each number.

For example, if the input list is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the function will return `[0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5]`.</s>  ```
def scale_to_0_1(my_list):
    return [x / max(my_list) for x in my_list]
```</s>  ```
def scale_list(numbers):
    return [number / max(numbers) for number in numbers]
```
This function takes a list of numbers as input, finds the maximum value in the list, and then divides each number by that maximum value to scale the list to be between 0 and 1.

Here is an example of how you can use this function:
```
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
scaled_numbers = scale_list(numbers)
print(scaled_numbers)  # [0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0]
```</s>  ```
def scale_list(numbers):
    return [n / max(numbers) for n in numbers]
```
Here's an explanation of how the code works:

* The function takes a list of numbers as input.
* It calculates the maximum value in the list using the `max()` function.
* It creates a new list where each element is the corresponding element in the input list divided by the maximum value. This scales the values to be between 0 and 1.
* It returns the new list.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
scaled_numbers = scale_list(numbers)
print(scaled_numbers)  # [0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0]
```</s>  ```

    return [number / max(numbers) for number in numbers]

  Here is a test suite using the `hypothesis` library to test a future solution for the problem of scaling a list of numbers to be between 0 and 1:
```
from hypothesis import given, strategies

def property_test(candidate_function) -> None:
    @given(strategies.lists(strategies.floats(min_value=0, max_value=1)))
    def property_1(input_list):
        output_list = candidate_function(input_list)
        assert all(0 <= x <= 1 for x in output_list)

    @given(strategies.lists(strategies.floats(min_value=0, max_value=1)))
    def property_2(input_list):
        output_list = candidate_function(input_list)
        assert all(x <= 1 for x in output_list)

    return [property_1, property_2]
```
This test suite includes two properties that test the following:

1. The output list contains only values between 0 and 1, inclusive.
2. The output list contains only values less than or equal to 1.

The `property_test` function takes a candidate function as input and returns a list of property tests. Each property test is defined using the `@given` decorator from `hypothesis`, which specifies the input values to use for the test. In this case, the input values are lists of floating-point numbers between 0 and 1, inclusive.

The `property_1` test checks that the output list contains only values between 0 and 1, inclusive. It does this by using the `all` function to check that every element in the output list is greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to 1.

The `property_2` test checks that the output list contains only values less than or equal to 1. It does this by using the `all` function to check that every element in the output list is less than or equal to 1.

To use this test suite, you can define a candidate function that scales a list of numbers to be between 0 and 1, and then pass it to the `property_test` function to run the test suite. For example:
```
def scale_list(input_list):
    return [x / max(input_list) for x in input_list]

property_test(scale_list)
```
This will run the test suite on the `scale_list` function and report any errors or failures.</s>  ```
def scale_to_0_1(numbers):
    return [number / max(numbers) for number in numbers]
```
This function takes a list of numbers as input, and returns a new list where each number is scaled to be between 0 and 1. The scaling is done by dividing each number by the maximum value in the list.

Here's an example of how to use this function:
```
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
scaled_numbers = scale_to_0_1(numbers)
print(scaled_numbers) # [0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0]
```</s>  ```
def scale_list(numbers):
    return [(x - min(numbers)) / (max(numbers) - min(numbers)) for x in numbers]
```
This code uses list comprehension to scale each number in the input list `numbers` to be between 0 and 1. It first finds the minimum and maximum values in the list using the `min()` and `max()` functions, and then subtracts the minimum from each number and divides by the range of the values (which is the difference between the maximum and minimum). This gives a scaled value between 0 and 1 for each number in the list.</s>  ```
import numpy as np

def scale_list(my_list):
    return np.interp(my_list, (np.min(my_list), np.max(my_list)), (0, 1))

```</s>  ```
import numpy as np

def scale_list(numbers):
    return np.interp(numbers, (numbers.min(), numbers.max()), (0, 1))
```
This function uses the `numpy.interp` function to scale the input list of numbers to be between 0 and 1. The `numpy.interp` function takes three arguments: the first is the input array, the second is the range of values to be interpolated (in this case, the minimum and maximum values of the input list), and the third is the range of values to be used for the interpolation (in this case, 0 and 1).

Here's an example of how you can use this function:
```
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
scaled_numbers = scale_list(numbers)
print(scaled_numbers)  # [0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0]
```</s>  ```
def scale_list(my_list):
    return [x / max(my_list) for x in my_list]
```
This function takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list where each element is scaled to be between 0 and 1. It does this by dividing each element by the maximum value in the original list.

Here's an example of how you can use this function:
```
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
scaled_list = scale_list(my_list)
print(scaled_list)  # [0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0]
```
This will output a list of numbers between 0 and 1, where each element is scaled to be the same distance from 0 as the corresponding element in the original list.</s>  ```
def scale_list(numbers):
    return [number / max(numbers) for number in numbers]
```
This function takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list where each number is scaled to be between 0 and 1. It does this by dividing each number by the maximum value in the list, which ensures that the largest number in the list will be scaled to 1, and all other numbers will be scaled accordingly.

Here's an example usage of this function:
```
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
scaled_numbers = scale_list(numbers)
print(scaled_numbers)  # [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5]
```</s>  ```
def scale_list(my_list):
    return [x / max(my_list) for x in my_list]
```
This function takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list where each element is scaled to be between 0 and 1. It does this by dividing each element by the maximum value in the list, which ensures that the largest value is 1 and the smallest value is 0.

Here's an example of how to use this function:
```
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
scaled_list = scale_list(my_list)
print(scaled_list)  # [0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0]

```
This function takes a list of numbers as input, and returns a new list where each element is scaled to be between 0 and 1. The scaling is done by dividing each element by the maximum value in the original list.

For example, if the input list is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the output list will be `[0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1]`.

Note that this function assumes that the input list is not empty and that the maximum value is not zero. If the input list is empty or the maximum value is zero, the function will return an empty list.</s>

This test suite tests the following properties of a function that scales a list of numbers to be between 0 and 1:

1. The resulting list should contain only values between 0 and 1.

def scale_list(my_list):
    return [x / max(my_list) for x in my_list]
```
This function takes a list of numbers as input, finds the maximum value in the list using the `max()` function, and then scales each number in the list by dividing it by the maximum value. This ensures that all numbers in the scaled list are between 0 and 1.

Here's an example of how you could use this function:
```
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
scaled_list = scale_list(my_list)

def scale_list(numbers):

```
This function takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list where each number is scaled to be between 0 and 1. The scaling is done by dividing each number by the maximum value in the input list.

Here's an example usage:
```
>>> scale_list([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
[0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5]
```</s>  ```
def scale_list(my_list):

This function takes a list of numbers as input, and returns a new list where each element is scaled to be between 0 and 1. The scaling is done by dividing each element by the maximum value in the original list.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```
>>> scale_list([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
[0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0]

Note that the function assumes that the input list is not empty, and will raise a `ZeroDivisionError` if the maximum value in the list is 0. If you need to handle this case, you can modify the function to check for this condition and return a special value (such as `None`) if the list is empty or contains only zeros.</s>  ```
def scale_list(numbers):

```</s>  ```
def scale_list(numbers):
    return [number / max(numbers) for number in numbers]
```
This function takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list where each number is scaled to be between 0 and 1. The scaling is done by dividing each number by the maximum value in the list.

Here's an example usage:
```
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
scaled_numbers = scale_list(numbers)
print(scaled_numbers)  # [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5]
```</s>  ```
def scale_list(numbers):
    return [number / max(numbers) for number in numbers]
```
Explanation:

This function takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list where each number is scaled to be between 0 and 1. The scaling is done by dividing each number by the maximum value in the list. This ensures that the largest number in the list is scaled to 1, and all other numbers are scaled accordingly.

For example, if the input list is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the output list would be `[0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1]`.</s>  Here is a Python code that scales a list of numbers to be between 0 and 1:
```
import numpy as np

def scale_list(numbers):
    return np.interp(numbers, (np.min(numbers), np.max(numbers)), (0, 1))
```
This code uses the `numpy.interp` function to scale the list of numbers to the range of 0 to 1. The `np.min` and `np.max` functions are used to determine the minimum and maximum values in the list, and the `np.interp` function is used to scale the list to the desired range.

Here is an example of how to use this function:
```
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
scaled_numbers = scale_list(numbers)
print(scaled_numbers) # [0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0]
```
This code will scale the list of numbers to be between 0 and 1, with the minimum value in the list being 0 and the maximum value being 1.</s>  ```
def scale_list(numbers):
    return [number / max(numbers) for number in numbers]
```
This function takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list where each number is scaled to be between 0 and 1. It does this by dividing each number by the maximum value in the list, which ensures that the largest number in the list is 1 and the smallest number is 0.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
scaled_numbers = scale_list(numbers)
print(scaled_numbers)  # [0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0]
```</s>  ```
def scale_list(numbers):
    return [n / max(numbers) for n in numbers]
```
This function takes a list of numbers as input, and returns a new list where each number is scaled to be between 0 and 1. The scaling is done by dividing each number by the maximum value in the input list.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
scaled_numbers = scale_list(numbers)
print(scaled_numbers)  # [0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0]
```</s>  ```
def scale_list(numbers):
    return [number / max(numbers) for number in numbers]
```
This code uses a list comprehension to create a new list where each element is the result of dividing the original element by the maximum value in the list. This will scale the list of numbers to be between 0 and 1.

For example, if the input list is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the output list will be `[0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0]`.</s>

**********************

  Sure! Here's a test suite for a hypothetical solution to the problem of scaling a list of numbers to be between 0 and 1 using the Hypothesis library:
```
from hypothesis import given, strategies

def property_test(candidate_function):
    @given(strategies.lists(strategies.floats(allow_infinity=False, allow_nan=False)))
    def test_scaling(numbers):
        scaled_numbers = candidate_function(numbers)
        assert all(0 <= n <= 1 for n in scaled_numbers)
        assert len(scaled_numbers) == len(numbers)
        return scaled_numbers

    @given(strategies.lists(strategies.floats(allow_infinity=False, allow_nan=False)))
    def test_identity(numbers):
        scaled_numbers = candidate_function(numbers)
        assert all(n == scaled_numbers[i] for i, n in enumerate(numbers))
        return scaled_numbers

    return [test_scaling, test_identity]
```
This test suite tests two properties of the scaling function:

1. The scaling function should return a list of numbers that are all between 0 and 1.
2. The scaling function should not change the order of the input list.

The test suite uses the `given` decorator to generate a list of floating-point numbers, and then tests the `candidate_function` (which is a hypothetical future solution to the problem) on this list. The `test_scaling` function checks that the output list is between 0 and 1, and that the length of the output list is the same as the length of the input list. The `test_identity` function checks that the output list is identical to the input list, except for the scaling factor.

This test suite covers the two properties of the scaling function, and can be used to test any future solution to the problem.</s>  ```
def scale_list(my_list):
    return [x / max(my_list) for x in my_list]
```
This function takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list where each element is scaled to be between 0 and 1. The scaling is done by dividing each element by the maximum value in the list.

Here's an example of how you can use this function:
```
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
scaled_list = scale_list(my_list)
print(scaled_list)  # [0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0]
```
Note that this function assumes that the input list is non-empty and contains only numbers. If the input list is empty or contains non-numeric values, the function will raise an error.</s>  ```
def scale_list(my_list):
    return [i / max(my_list) for i in my_list]
```
Here's an explanation of how the code works:

1. The `max` function is used to find the maximum value in the list.
2. The list comprehension is used to create a new list where each element is the result of dividing the corresponding element of the original list by the maximum value. This scales the values to be between 0 and 1.

Here's an example of how to use the function:
```
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
scaled_list = scale_list(my_list)
print(scaled_list)  # [0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0]
```</s>  ```
def scale_list(my_list):
    return [x / max(my_list) for x in my_list]
```
This function takes a list of numbers as input, finds the maximum value in the list, and then scales each number in the list by dividing it by the maximum value. This will result in a list of numbers between 0 and 1.

Here's an example of how to use the function:
```
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
scaled_list = scale_list(my_list)
print(scaled_list)  # [0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0]
```</s>  ```
def scale_to_0_1(numbers):
    return [number / max(numbers) for number in numbers]
```
This function takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list where each number is scaled to be between 0 and 1. It does this by dividing each number by the maximum value in the list.

Here is an example of how you could use this function:
```
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
scaled_numbers = scale_to_0_1(numbers)
print(scaled_numbers)  # [0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0]
```
This code will output a list of numbers between 0 and 1, where each number is scaled to be between 0 and 1.

You can also use the `numpy` library to achieve the same result:
```
import numpy as np

def scale_to_0_1(numbers):
    return np.array(numbers) / np.max(numbers)
```
This code will also output a list of numbers between 0 and 1, where each number is scaled to be between 0 and 1.

Please note that the `numpy` library is not included in the Python standard library, so you will need to install it before you can use it. You can install `numpy` using pip:
```
pip install numpy
```</s>  Here is a Python code sample that scales a list of numbers to be between 0 and 1:
```
def scale_list(numbers):
    """
    Scales a list of numbers to be between 0 and 1.

    Args:
        numbers (list): The list of numbers to be scaled.

    Returns:
        list: The scaled list of numbers.
    """
    min_val = min(numbers)
    max_val = max(numbers)
    return [(x - min_val) / (max_val - min_val) for x in numbers]
```
Here is an explanation of how the code works:

1. The `min_val` and `max_val` variables are assigned the minimum and maximum values in the `numbers` list, respectively.
2. The `return` statement uses a list comprehension to create a new list where each element is the difference between the corresponding element in the `numbers` list and `min_val`, divided by the difference between `max_val` and `min_val`. This scaling formula maps the original values to a range of 0 to 1.

You can test the code by calling the `scale_list` function with a list of numbers as the argument, like this:
```
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
scaled_numbers = scale_list(numbers)
print(scaled_numbers)  # [0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0]
```</s>  ```
def scale_list(numbers):
    return [number / max(numbers) for number in numbers]
```
This function takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list where each number is scaled to be between 0 and 1. It does this by dividing each number by the maximum value in the list.

Here is an example of how you can use this function:
```
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
scaled_numbers = scale_list(numbers)
print(scaled_numbers)  # [0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0]
```
In this example, the function takes the list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` as input and returns the list `[0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0]`.</s>  ```
def scale_to_unit_interval(numbers):
    return [number / max(numbers) for number in numbers]
```
Example:
```
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
scaled_numbers = scale_to_unit_interval(numbers)
print(scaled_numbers) # [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5]
```</s>  Here's a possible solution:
```
import numpy as np

def scale_list(my_list):
    return np.interp(my_list, (np.min(my_list), np.max(my_list)), (0, 1))
```
Explanation:

* `np.interp` is a numpy function that interpolates a list of values to be between a given range.
* In this case, we use `np.min(my_list)` and `np.max(my_list)` as the range of the input values, and `(0, 1)` as the range of the output values.
* The `np.interp` function returns a new list of values that have been scaled to be between 0 and 1.

Here's an example usage of the `scale_list` function:
```
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
scaled_list = scale_list(my_list)
print(scaled_list)  # [0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0]
```</s>  ```
def scale_list(numbers):
    return [(x - min(numbers)) / (max(numbers) - min(numbers)) for x in numbers]
```
This function takes a list of numbers as input, and returns a new list where each number is scaled to be between 0 and 1. The scaling is done by subtracting the minimum value in the list from each number, and then dividing by the range of the list (i.e. the maximum value minus the minimum value). This will give a list of numbers between 0 and 1.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
scaled_numbers = scale_list(numbers)
print(scaled_numbers)  # [0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0]
```</s>  ```
def scale_list(numbers):
    return [n / max(numbers) for n in numbers]
```
This function takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list where each number is scaled to be between 0 and 1. The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the input list and applies the scaling formula `n / max(numbers)` to each number. The `max` function is used to find the maximum value in the input list, which is used as the scaling factor.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
scaled_numbers = scale_list(numbers)
print(scaled_numbers)  # [0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0]

This test suite defines two properties to test the future solution:

1. The first property checks that the output list contains only values between 0 and 1.
2. The second property checks that all the values in the output list are between 0 and 1.

Both properties use the `strategies.lists` and `strategies.floats` strategies to generate random input lists of floating-point numbers. The `strategies.floats` strategy is used to generate random floating-point numbers between 0 and 100.

The `property_test` function takes a candidate function as input and returns a list of property tests. The candidate function is the future solution that is being tested. The property tests are run using the `given` decorator, which generates random inputs and runs the property tests. If any of the properties fail, the test will raise an exception.</s>  Here's one way to scale a list of numbers to be between 0 and 1 in Python:
```
import numpy as np

def scale_list(my_list):

This function uses the `numpy` library to perform the scaling. It first finds the minimum and maximum values in the input list using `np.min` and `np.max`, respectively. It then uses `np.interp` to linearly interpolate between these values to create a new list of values between 0 and 1.

scaled_list = scale_list(my_list)
print(scaled_list)  # [0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0]

    return [number / max(numbers) for number in numbers]
```
This function takes a list of numbers as input, and returns a new list where each number is scaled to be between 0 and 1. It does this by dividing each number by the maximum value in the list.

Here's an example of how you could use this function:
```
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
scaled_numbers = scale_list(numbers)
print(scaled_numbers)  # [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5]
```</s>  ```
def scale_to_0_1(numbers):
    return [(x - min(numbers)) / (max(numbers) - min(numbers)) for x in numbers]
```
This function takes a list of numbers as input, finds the minimum and maximum values in the list, and then scales each number to be between 0 and 1 using the formula:

(x - min) / (max - min)

This formula will always result in a value between 0 and 1, regardless of the input values.

Here is an example of how to use this function:
```
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
scaled_numbers = scale_to_0_1(numbers)
print(scaled_numbers) # [0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0]
```</s>  Here's a possible solution using NumPy:
```
import numpy as np

def scale_to_0_1(my_list):
    return np.interp(my_list, (np.min(my_list), np.max(my_list)), (0, 1))
```
This function takes a list of numbers as input, finds the minimum and maximum values in the list using `np.min` and `np.max`, and then uses `np.interp` to linearly interpolate the values in the list to the range [0, 1].

For example:
```
>>> scale_to_0_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
array([0. , 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8])
```
Note that the output is a NumPy array. If you want a Python list, you can convert it using `list(scale_to_0_1(my_list))`.</s>  ```
def scale_list(numbers):
    return [number / max(numbers) for number in numbers]
```
This function takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list where each number is scaled to be between 0 and 1. The scaling is done by dividing each number by the maximum value in the list.

Here's an example of how to use this function:
```
numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
scaled_numbers = scale_list(numbers)
print(scaled_numbers)  # [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5]

def scale_list(my_list):
    return [x / max(my_list) for x in my_list]
```
This function takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list where each element is scaled to be between 0 and 1. The scaling is done by dividing each element by the maximum value in the list.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
scaled_list = scale_list(my_list)
print(scaled_list)  # [0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0]
```
This function can be used to scale any list of numbers, regardless of their original range.</s>  Here's one way to scale a list of numbers to be between 0 and 1 in Python:
```
import numpy as np

def scale_list(numbers):
    return np.interp(numbers, (numbers.min(), numbers.max()), (0, 1))
```
Here's an explanation of how this code works:

1. The `numpy` library is used to perform the interpolation.
2. The `interp` function takes three arguments: the first is the array of numbers to be scaled, the second is the range of values to be scaled to (in this case, the minimum and maximum values in the array), and the third is the range of values to be scaled from (in this case, 0 and 1).
3. The `np.interp` function returns a new array of scaled values.

Here's an example of how to use this function:
```
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
scaled_numbers = scale_list(numbers)
print(scaled_numbers)  # [0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0]

**********************

  Sure! Here is a test suite using the Hypothesis library to test a future solution for the problem of scaling a list of numbers to be between 0 and 1:
```
from hypothesis import given, strategies

def property_test(candidate_function):
    @given(strategies.lists(strategies.floats(min_value=0, max_value=1)))
    def property_1(input_list):
        output_list = candidate_function(input_list)
        assert all(0 <= x <= 1 for x in output_list)

    @given(strategies.lists(strategies.floats(min_value=0, max_value=1)))
    def property_2(input_list):
        output_list = candidate_function(input_list)
        assert all(x <= 1 for x in output_list)

    return [property_1, property_2]
```
This test suite includes two property tests:

1. `property_1` tests that the output list contains only values between 0 and 1.
2. `property_2` tests that the output list contains only values less than or equal to 1.

Both property tests use the `strategies.lists` strategy to generate lists of floats, and the `strategies.floats` strategy to generate floats with a minimum value of 0 and a maximum value of 1.

The `property_test` function takes a candidate function as input and returns a list of property tests. The candidate function is the future solution for the problem of scaling a list of numbers to be between 0 and 1. The property tests are then applied to the candidate function to ensure that it satisfies the desired properties.</s>  Here's one way to scale a list of numbers to be between 0 and 1 in Python:
```
import numpy as np

def scale_list(my_list):
    return np.interp(my_list, (my_list.min(), my_list.max()), (0, 1))
```
Here's an explanation of how the code works:

* `numpy` is a library for numerical computing in Python. We import it as `np` for convenience.
* `my_list.min()` and `my_list.max()` are used to find the minimum and maximum values in the list, respectively.
* `np.interp()` is a function that performs linear interpolation between two sets of values. In this case, we use it to map the minimum and maximum values in the list to 0 and 1, respectively.
* The resulting list of scaled values is returned by the `scale_list()` function.

Here's an example of how you could use the `scale_list()` function:
```
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
scaled_list = scale_list(my_list)
print(scaled_list)  # [0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1]
```
Note that the `scale_list()` function will only work with lists of numerical values. If you have a list of strings or other non-numerical values, you'll need to convert them to numerical values before calling the function.</s>  ```
def scale_list(my_list):
    return [x / max(my_list) for x in my_list]
```
This function takes a list of numbers as input, and returns a new list where each element is scaled to be between 0 and 1. It does this by dividing each element by the maximum value in the original list.

Here's an example usage:
```
>>> scale_list([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
[0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0]
```
This function assumes that the input list is not empty, and that all elements are of the same type (i.e., all integers or all floats). If the input list is empty, the function will raise a `ZeroDivisionError`. If the elements are of different types, the function will raise a `TypeError`.</s>  ```
def scale_list(numbers):
    return [number / max(numbers) for number in numbers]
```</s>  ```
def scale_list(numbers):
    return [number / max(numbers) for number in numbers]
```
This function takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list where each number is scaled to be between 0 and 1. It does this by dividing each number by the maximum value in the input list.

Here's an example usage:
```
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
scaled_numbers = scale_list(numbers)
print(scaled_numbers)  # [0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0]
```
This code uses a list comprehension to create a new list where each number is scaled by dividing it by the maximum value in the input list. The `max` function is used to find the maximum value in the input list.</s>  Here's an example of how you could scale a list of numbers to be between 0 and 1 using Python:
```
from statistics import mean

def scale_list(numbers):
    # Calculate the mean of the list
    mean_value = mean(numbers)

    # Create a new list with the scaled values
    scaled_list = []
    for num in numbers:
        scaled_list.append((num - mean_value) / (max(numbers) - min(numbers)))

    return scaled_list
```
This function takes a list of numbers as input, calculates the mean of the list, and then scales each value in the list to be between 0 and 1 by subtracting the mean and dividing by the range of the list. The resulting scaled list is then returned.

You can test this function with the following code:
```
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
scaled_numbers = scale_list(numbers)
print(scaled_numbers)
```
This should output the scaled list `[0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0]`.</s>  ```
def scale_list(numbers):
    return [number / max(numbers) for number in numbers]
```
This function takes a list of numbers as input, and returns a new list where each number is scaled to be between 0 and 1. It does this by dividing each number by the maximum value in the list, which ensures that the largest value in the list is 1, and all other values are scaled accordingly.

Here's an example of how this function would work:
```
numbers = [10, 5, 2, 15]
scaled_numbers = scale_list(numbers)
print(scaled_numbers) # [0.5, 0.25, 0.1, 0.75]
```
In this example, the largest value in the list is 15, so the function divides each number by 15 to get the scaled values.</s>  ```
def scale_list(my_list):
    return [x / max(my_list) for x in my_list]
```
This function takes a list of numbers as input, and returns a new list where each number is scaled to be between 0 and 1. It does this by dividing each number by the maximum value in the input list, which ensures that the largest number in the list is 1, and all other numbers are scaled accordingly.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```
>>> scale_list([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
[0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0]
```</s>  ```
def scale_list(numbers):
    return [n / max(numbers) for n in numbers]
```
This function takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list where each number is scaled to be between 0 and 1. It does this by dividing each number by the maximum value in the list, which ensures that the largest number is 1 and the smallest number is 0.

Here's an example of how to use this function:
```
numbers = [10, 5, 25, 100]
scaled_numbers = scale_list(numbers)
print(scaled_numbers) # [0.1, 0.05, 0.25, 1]
```
This code will print the scaled list of numbers, which are all between 0 and 1.</s>  Here's a possible solution:
```
import numpy as np

def scale_list(numbers):
    return np.interp(numbers, (numbers.min(), numbers.max()), (0, 1))
```
This solution uses the `numpy` library to perform linear interpolation between the minimum and maximum values of the input list. The `interp` function takes three arguments: the first is the input list, the second is the range of values to interpolate between, and the third is the range of values to map the input list to. In this case, we're interpolating between the minimum and maximum values of the input list, and mapping the input list to the range [0, 1].

Here's an example usage:
```
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
scaled_numbers = scale_list(numbers)
print(scaled_numbers)  # [0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0]
```</s>  ```
def scale_list(numbers):
    return [number / max(numbers) for number in numbers]
```
This function takes a list of numbers as input, finds the maximum value in the list, and then scales each number by dividing it by the maximum value. This ensures that all the numbers in the output list are between 0 and 1.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
scaled_numbers = scale_list(numbers)
print(scaled_numbers)  # [0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0]

**********************

  Here's a test suite that uses the `hypothesis` library to generate property tests for a hypothetical function that scales a list of numbers to be between 0 and 1:
```
from hypothesis import given, strategies

def property_test(candidate_function) -> None:
    @given(strategies.lists(strategies.floats(min_value=0, max_value=1)))
    def property_1(input_list):
        result = candidate_function(input_list)
        assert all(0 <= x <= 1 for x in result)

    @given(strategies.lists(strategies.floats(min_value=0, max_value=1)))
    def property_2(input_list):
        result = candidate_function(input_list)
        assert all(result[i] <= result[i + 1] for i in range(len(result) - 1))

    return [property_1, property_2]
```
This test suite generates two property tests:

1. The first property test checks that the resulting list contains only values between 0 and 1.
2. The second property test checks that the resulting list is sorted in ascending order.

To use this test suite, you would need to define a function that takes a list of numbers as input and returns a list of numbers between 0 and 1. You can then pass this function to the `property_test` function to run the property tests. For example:
```
def scale_to_0_1(input_list):
    # Your implementation here
    pass

property_test(scale_to_0_1)
```
Note that this is just an example, and you would need to replace the `pass` statement with your own implementation of the `scale_to_0_1` function.</s>  ```
def scale_list(numbers):
    return [(number - min(numbers)) / (max(numbers) - min(numbers)) for number in numbers]
```
Here's an explanation of how the code works:

1. First, we find the minimum and maximum values in the list using the `min` and `max` functions.
2. Then, we subtract the minimum value from each number in the list to make the minimum value 0.
3. Next, we divide each number by the range of the values (which is the maximum value minus the minimum value). This scales the numbers so that they are between 0 and 1.
4. Finally, we return the list of scaled numbers.

Here's an example of how to use the function:
```
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
scaled_numbers = scale_list(numbers)
print(scaled_numbers)  # [0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0]
```</s>  ```
def scale_to_zero_one(numbers):
    return [number / max(numbers) for number in numbers]
```
This code uses list comprehension to create a new list where each number is divided by the maximum value in the original list. This will result in a list of numbers between 0 and 1.

Here's an example usage:
```
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
scaled_numbers = scale_to_zero_one(numbers)
print(scaled_numbers)  # [0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0]

```</s>  ```
def scale_list(my_list):
    return [x / max(my_list) for x in my_list]
```
This function takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list where each element is scaled to be between 0 and 1. It does this by dividing each element by the maximum value in the original list.

For example, if the input list is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the output list would be `[0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0]`.</s>  ```
def scale_to_unit_interval(numbers):

Here is an example of how you can use this function:
```
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
scaled_numbers = scale_to_unit_interval(numbers)
print(scaled_numbers)  # [0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0]
```
In this example, the input list `numbers` is scaled to be between 0 and 1, and the resulting list `scaled_numbers` contains the scaled values.</s>  ```
def scale_list(numbers):
    return [(x - min(numbers)) / (max(numbers) - min(numbers)) for x in numbers]
```
Explanation:

1. First, we find the minimum and maximum values in the list using the `min()` and `max()` functions.
2. Then, we use a list comprehension to iterate over the list and calculate the scaled value for each number. We subtract the minimum value from the current number and divide by the difference between the minimum and maximum values. This gives us a value between 0 and 1.
3. Finally, we return the list of scaled values.

Example:
```
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
scaled_numbers = scale_list(numbers)
print(scaled_numbers)  # [0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0]
```</s>  ```
def scale_list(numbers):

scaled_numbers = scale_list(numbers)
print(scaled_numbers) # [0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0]

In this example, the input list `numbers` has a maximum value of 5, so each number is scaled by dividing by 5. The resulting list `scaled_numbers` contains the scaled values, which are between 0 and 1.</s>  ```

Here is an example of how to use this function:
```
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
scaled_list = scale_list(my_list)
print(scaled_list)  # [0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0]
```</s>  Here's a possible solution:
```
import numpy as np

def scale_list(my_list):
    return np.interp(my_list, (my_list.min(), my_list.max()), (0, 1))
```
Explanation:

* The `numpy.interp` function is used to interpolate the values in the list to be between 0 and 1.
* The `my_list.min()` and `my_list.max()` functions are used to get the minimum and maximum values in the list.
* The resulting list is then returned.

Here's an example usage:
```
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
scaled_list = scale_list(my_list)
print(scaled_list)  # [0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0]
```</s>  ```
def scale_to_0_1(numbers):
    return [number / max(numbers) for number in numbers]
```
This code defines a function `scale_to_0_1` that takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list of numbers that have been scaled to be between 0 and 1. It does this by dividing each number by the maximum value in the input list, which ensures that the largest number in the list is scaled to 1. The resulting list will contain only values between 0 and 1.

Here is an example of how you could use this function:
```
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
scaled_numbers = scale_to_0_1(numbers)
print(scaled_numbers)  # [0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0]
```
In this example, the input list `numbers` contains the values [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. The `scale_to_0_1` function scales these values to be between 0 and 1, and the resulting list `scaled_numbers` contains the values [0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0].</s>  Here's one way to scale a list of numbers to be between 0 and 1 in Python:
```
import numpy as np

def scale_list(my_list):
    return np.interp(my_list, (my_list.min(), my_list.max()), (0, 1))
```
Here's an explanation of how this code works:

1. The `numpy` module is imported as `np`.
2. The `scale_list` function takes a list of numbers as input.
3. The `my_list.min()` and `my_list.max()` methods are used to find the minimum and maximum values in the list, respectively.
4. The `np.interp` function is used to interpolate the values in the list to be between 0 and 1. The first argument is the list of values to be interpolated, the second argument is the range of values to be interpolated, and the third argument is the range of values to be interpolated to.
5. The `scale_list` function returns the scaled list.

Here's an example usage of the `scale_list` function:
```
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
scaled_list = scale_list(my_list)
print(scaled_list)  # [0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0]

CURRENT BEST CANDIDATE: (None, 0)
**********************

  Here's a test suite using the Hypothesis library to test a future solution for the problem "Scale a list of numbers to be between 0 and 1":
```
from hypothesis import given, strategies

def property_test(candidate_function) -> None:
    @given(strategies.lists(strategies.floats(min_value=0, max_value=100)))
    def property_1(input_list):
        result = candidate_function(input_list)
        assert all(0 <= x <= 1 for x in result)

    @given(strategies.lists(strategies.floats(min_value=0, max_value=100)))
    def property_2(input_list):
        result = candidate_function(input_list)
        assert all(x >= 0 and x <= 1 for x in result)

    return [property_1, property_2]
```
This test suite contains two property tests:

1. `property_1`: This test checks that the output of the candidate function is a list of numbers between 0 and 1, inclusive.
2. `property_2`: This test checks that the output of the candidate function is a list of non-negative numbers that are less than or equal to 1.

Both tests use the `strategies.lists` and `strategies.floats` strategies to generate random lists of floating-point numbers. The `min_value` and `max_value` arguments are used to specify the range of values that should be generated.

In the `property_1` test, the `all` function is used to check that all elements of the output list are between 0 and 1, inclusive. In the `property_2` test, the `all` function is used to check that all elements of the output list are non-negative and less than or equal to 1.

Note that this is just one possible test suite for this problem, and there may be other ways to test the solution.</s>  ```
def scale_list(numbers):
    return [number / max(numbers) for number in numbers]

[0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5]
```
This function takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list where each number is scaled to be between 0 and 1. The scaling is done by dividing each number by the maximum value in the input list. This ensures that the largest number in the input list is scaled to 1, and the other numbers are scaled proportionally.</s>  ```

```</s>  Here's a possible solution to the problem:
```
def scale_list(numbers):
    return [number / max(numbers) for number in numbers]
```
Here's an explanation of how the code works:

1. The `scale_list` function takes a list of numbers as an argument.
2. It uses a list comprehension to create a new list where each element is the result of dividing the corresponding element of the original list by the maximum value in the original list. This will scale the numbers to be between 0 and 1.
3. The `max` function is used to find the maximum value in the original list.
4. The resulting list is returned.

Here's an example of how to use the `scale_list` function:
```
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
scaled_numbers = scale_list(numbers)
print(scaled_numbers)  # [0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0]
