Prompt: Return a lowest common multiple of two integers.
-------------------
  Here is a test suite for the given problem:
```
{
    "lcm_test": {
        "in": {
            "a": 12,
            "b": 15
        },
        "out": 60
    },
    "lcm_test2": {
        "in": {
            "a": 10,
            "b": 15
        },
        "out": 30
    },
    "lcm_test3": {
        "in": {
            "a": 12,
            "b": 18
        },
        "out": 36
    }
}
```
This test suite includes three tests, each with a different set of inputs and expected outputs. The first test checks the result of the least common multiple of 12 and 15, which should be 60. The second test checks the result of the least common multiple of 10 and 15, which should be 30. The third test checks the result of the least common multiple of 12 and 18, which should be 36.</s>  ```
def lowest_common_multiple(a, b):
    if a > b:
        a, b = b, a
    for i in range(a, b*a + 1, a):
        if i % b == 0:
            return i
```

This function takes two integers `a` and `b` and returns the lowest common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`. The function first checks if `a` is greater than `b`, and if so, swaps them. Then, it starts from the smaller number `a` and iterates up to `b*a + 1` in steps of `a`, checking if each number is divisible by `b`. If a number is divisible by `b`, it means it is a multiple of both `a` and `b`, so the function returns that number as the LCM.

Here is an example usage of the function:
```
print(lowest_common_multiple(12, 15)) # Output: 60
```
This code will return the LCM of 12 and 15, which is 60.</s>  ```
def lcm(a, b):
    if a > b:
        greater = a
    else:
        greater = b
    while True:
        if (greater % a == 0) and (greater % b == 0):
            lcm = greater
            break
        greater += 1
    return lcm
```</s>  ```
def lcm(a, b):
    if a > b:
        greater = a
    else:
        greater = b
    while True:
        if (greater % a == 0) and (greater % b == 0):
            lcm = greater
            break
        greater += 1
    return lcm
```</s>  ```
def lowest_common_multiple(a, b):
    if a > b:

    for i in range(a, b*a + 1, a):

            return i
```
This code uses the fact that the lowest common multiple of two integers `a` and `b` is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both `a` and `b`. The function first swaps `a` and `b` if `a` is greater than `b`, so that `a` is always the smaller number. Then, it loops through all the multiples of `a` from `a` to `b*a` (inclusive), and checks if any of them is divisible by `b`. If it finds one, it returns that number as the lowest common multiple. If no such number is found, it means that `a` and `b` are coprime, and the lowest common multiple is `a*b`.</s>  ```
def lowest_common_multiple(a, b):
    if a > b:
        a, b = b, a
    for i in range(a, b*a + 1, a):
        if i % b == 0:
            return i
```
This function takes two integers `a` and `b` as input and returns the lowest common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`. The function first checks if `a` is greater than `b` and swaps them if necessary, so that `a` is always the smaller number. Then, it starts iterating from `a` to `b*a + 1` with a step size of `a`, and checks if each number is divisible by `b`. If it finds a number that is divisible by `b`, it returns that number as the LCM. If no number is found, the function returns `None`.

Here is an example usage of the function:
```
print(lowest_common_multiple(12, 15)) # Output: 60
print(lowest_common_multiple(7, 11)) # Output: 77
print(lowest_common_multiple(10, 17)) # Output: 105

        greater += 1
    return lcm

            lcm = greater
            break
        greater += 1
    return lcm

def lowest_common_multiple(a, b):
    if a > b:
        a, b = b, a
    for i in range(a, b*2, a):
        if i % b == 0:
            return i
```

This function takes two integers `a` and `b` and returns the lowest common multiple (LCM) of the two numbers. The function first checks if `a` is greater than `b`, and if so, it swaps the two variables. Then, it starts iterating from `a` to `2*b` in steps of `a`, and checks if each number is a multiple of `b`. If it finds a number that is a multiple of `b`, it returns that number as the LCM.

Here is an explanation of the code:

1. `if a > b: a, b = b, a`: This line checks if `a` is greater than `b`, and if so, it swaps the two variables. This ensures that the loop starts from the smaller number and ends at the larger number.
2. `for i in range(a, b*2, a):`: This line starts a loop that iterates from `a` to `2*b` in steps of `a`. This ensures that the loop checks all the numbers between `a` and `2*b` that are multiples of `a`.
3. `if i % b == 0: return i`: This line checks if the current number `i` is a multiple of `b`. If it is, the function returns `i` as the LCM.

Here is an example of how the function would work for the input `a = 6` and `b = 8`:

1. The function first checks if `a` is greater than `b`. Since `6` is less than `8`, the function does not swap the variables.
2. The function starts iterating from `a` to `2*b` in steps of `a`. This means it checks the numbers `6`, `12`, `18`, `24`, and `30`.
3. The function checks if each of these numbers is a multiple of `b`. Since `12` is a multiple of `8`, the function returns `12` as the LCM.

Therefore, the lowest common multiple of `6` and `8` is `12`.</s>  ```
