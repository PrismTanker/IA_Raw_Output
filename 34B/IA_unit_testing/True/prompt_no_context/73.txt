Prompt: 
    Given an array arr of integers, find the minimum number of elements that
    need to be changed to make the array palindromic. A palindromic array is an array that
    is read the same backwards and forwards. In one change, you can change one element to any other element.

    For example:
    smallest_change([1,2,3,5,4,7,9,6]) == 4
    smallest_change([1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 2]) == 1
    smallest_change([1, 2, 3, 2, 1]) == 0
    
-------------------
  Here is a test suite that covers several edge cases and a few examples of palindromic arrays:
```
{
    "test_empty_array": {
        "in": {
            "arr": []
        },
        "out": 0
    },
    "test_single_element_array": {
        "in": {
            "arr": [1]
        },
        "out": 0
    },
    "test_two_element_array": {
        "in": {
            "arr": [1, 2]
        },
        "out": 1
    },
    "test_palindromic_array": {
        "in": {
            "arr": [1, 2, 3, 2, 1]
        },
        "out": 0
    },
    "test_non_palindromic_array": {
        "in": {
            "arr": [1, 2, 3, 5, 4, 7, 9, 6]
        },
        "out": 4
    },
    "test_non_palindromic_array_with_duplicates": {
        "in": {
            "arr": [1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 2]
        },
        "out": 1
    }
}
```
Note that this test suite assumes that the `smallest_change` function is implemented as a pure function, meaning it has no side effects and always returns the same output given the same input. If the function has side effects, the test suite may need to be modified to account for these effects.</s>
