  Here is a test suite for the `factorize` function:

{
    "factorize": {
        "in": {
            "n": 8
        },
        "out": [2, 2, 2]
    },

    }
}
```
This test suite includes three test cases, each with a different input and expected output. The test cases are:

* `factorize(8)`: This test case checks that the function correctly returns a list of prime factors for the input `8`. The expected output is `[2, 2, 2]`.
* `factorize(25)`: This test case checks that the function correctly returns a list of prime factors for the input `25`. The expected output is `[5, 5]`.
* `factorize(70)`: This test case checks that the function correctly returns a list of prime factors for the input `70`. The expected output is `[2, 5, 7]`.

Note that the test cases are written in the form of JSON objects, with the input values and expected outputs specified in the `in` and `out` properties, respectively. The test cases are labeled with the name of the function being tested (`factorize`) and the input value (e.g. `factorize(8)`).</s>  Here's a test suite for the `factorize` function:
