Prompt: Write a function that returns true if the given number can be divided by 3 prime numbers
    and false otherwise.
    Knowing that (a) is less then 100. 
    Example:
    is_multiply_prime(30) == True
    30 = 2 * 3 * 5

}</s>  Here is a JSON sample that represents a test suite to test the solution to the problem you described:
```
{
    "test_is_prime": {
        "in": {
            "n": 30
        },
        "out": true
    },
    "test_is_not_prime": {
        "in": {
            "n": 31
        },
        "out": false
    },
    "test_is_prime_with_small_number": {
        "in": {
            "n": 10
        },
        "out": true
    },
    "test_is_not_prime_with_small_number": {
        "in": {
            "n": 9
        },
        "out": false
    }
}
```
In this JSON sample, each key-value pair represents a test case, where the key is the name of the test (e.g. "test_is_prime"), and the value is a dictionary that contains the input parameters (e.g. "in") and the expected output (e.g. "out").

In the example above, there are four test cases:

* "test_is_prime": This test case checks if the given number (30) is divisible by 3 prime numbers (2, 3, and 5). Since 30 is divisible by all three prime numbers, the expected output is "true".
* "test_is_not_prime": This test case checks if the given number (31) is divisible by 3 prime numbers. Since 31 is not divisible by any prime numbers, the expected output is "false".
* "test_is_prime_with_small_number": This test case checks if the given number (10) is divisible by 3 prime numbers. Since 10 is divisible by only two prime numbers (2 and 5), the expected output is "true".
* "test_is_not_prime_with_small_number": This test case checks if the given number (9) is divisible by 3 prime numbers. Since 9 is not divisible by any prime numbers, the expected output is "false".

Note that the JSON sample uses all lower case for "true" and "false" values, which is the standard convention in JSON.</s>  ```
def is_multiply_prime(n):
    if n < 100:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```
Explanation:

The function first checks if the given number is less than 100. If it is, it returns False immediately since the number cannot be divided by 3 prime numbers.

Next, the function iterates through the range of numbers from 2 to the square root of the given number (since if a number is not divisible by a prime number less than its square root, it cannot be divided by 3 prime numbers). For each number in the range, the function checks if it divides the given number. If any number divides the given number, the function returns False.

Finally, if the function reaches the end of the range without finding any divisor, it returns True, indicating that the given number can be divided by 3 prime numbers.</s>  ```
def is_multiply_prime(n):
    if n < 100:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```
Explanation:

The function first checks if the given number `n` is less than 100. If it is, it returns `False` immediately, since it cannot be divided by any prime numbers.

Next, the function iterates from 2 to the square root of `n` and checks if `n` is divisible by any number in this range. If it finds a divisor, it returns `False`. If it reaches the end of the range and does not find any divisor, it returns `True`.

Note that the function uses the `range` function to generate a sequence of numbers from 2 to the square root of `n`, and the `int` function to convert the square root to an integer.</s>  ```
def is_multiply_prime(n):
    if n < 100:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```
This function uses a simple loop to check if the given number can be divided by any prime number less than or equal to the square root of the number. If a prime number is found, the function returns False. If the loop completes without finding any prime factors, the function returns True.</s>  ```
def is_multiple_prime(num):
    for i in range(2, num):
        if num % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```
Explanation:
The function iterates through the range of numbers from 2 to the given number (num) and checks if any of them divide the given number without leaving a remainder. If no such number exists, the function returns True, indicating that the given number can be divided by 3 prime numbers.</s>  Here is a Python function that determines if a number is divisible by three prime numbers:
```
def is_divisible_by_three_prime_numbers(n):
    if n < 100:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0 and (n // i) % 2 == 0:
            return True
    return False
```
This function first checks if the input number is less than 100, and if it is, it returns False. Otherwise, it iterates from 2 to the square root of the input number and checks if the number is divisible by any prime number. If the number is divisible by a prime number and the result of dividing the number by that prime number is even, the function returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.</s>  ```
def is_multiply_prime(n):
    if n < 100:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0 and is_prime(i) and is_prime(n // i):
            return True
    return False

def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```
This code checks if a number is divisible by 3 prime numbers by checking if it can be divided by two prime factors. The function `is_prime` checks if a number is prime by checking if it is divisible by any number between 2 and the square root of the number.</s>  ```
def is_multiple_prime(n):
    if n < 100:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```
This function first checks if the given number is less than 100, if it is, it returns False immediately. Then it loops through all the numbers from 2 to the square root of the given number and checks if the number is divisible by any of them. If it finds a divisor, it returns False. If it reaches the end of the loop without finding a divisor, it returns True.

Note that this function assumes that the number is greater than 0. If the number can be negative, you need to add a check for that.</s>  Here's a solution using the `math` module:
```
import math

def is_multiply_prime(n):
    if n < 100:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```
This function uses the `math.sqrt` function to calculate the square root of the given number, and then iterates from 2 to the square root using a for loop. For each number `i`, it checks if `n` is divisible by `i` using the modulo operator (`%`). If any number is found that divides `n`, the function returns `False`. If the loop completes without finding any divisor, the function returns `True`.</s>  Here is a possible solution:
```
def is_multiply_prime(n):
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```
This function uses a simple loop to check if the given number `n` can be divided by any of the prime numbers less than or equal to its square root. If a prime number is found, the function returns `False`. If the loop completes without finding a prime number, the function returns `True`.

Note that this function assumes that the input `n` is a positive integer. If the input can be negative or non-integer, additional checks may be needed to handle those cases.</s>
