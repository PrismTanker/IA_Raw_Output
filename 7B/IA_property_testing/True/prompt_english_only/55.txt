Prompt: Return n-th Fibonacci number.
-------------------
  Here is a test suite that will test a future solution to the problem of returning the n-th Fibonacci number:
```
from hypothesis import given, strategies

def property_test(candidate_function):
    @given(strategies.integers(min_value=0))
    def property_1(n):
        assert candidate_function(n) == nth_fibonacci_number(n)

    @given(strategies.integers(min_value=1))
    def property_2(n):
        assert candidate_function(n) == nth_fibonacci_number(n)

    return [property_1, property_2]
```
The `property_test` function takes a candidate function as an argument and returns a list containing two property tests. The first property test, `property_1`, checks that the candidate function returns the correct value for the first two Fibonacci numbers (0 and 1). The second property test, `property_2`, checks that the candidate function returns the correct value for all Fibonacci numbers greater than 1.

To use this test suite, you can import the `property_test` function and pass in your future solution as an argument. For example:
```
from hypothesis import strategies

def nth_fibonacci_number(n):
    # Your future solution to the problem goes here

property_tests = property_test(nth_fibonacci_number)
```
You can then use the `property_tests` list to run your tests using a property testing framework such as Hypothesis. For example:
```
from hypothesis import given, strategies

@given(strategies.integers(min_value=0))
def test_first_two_fibonacci_numbers(n):
    assert nth_fibonacci_number(n) == nth_fibonacci_number(n)

@given(strategies.integers(min_value=1))
def test_all_fibonacci_numbers_greater_than_1(n):
    assert nth_fibonacci_number(n) == nth_fibonacci_number(n)
```
You can then run the tests using the `hypothesis` module:
```
from hypothesis import given, strategies

hypothesis.run(test_first_two_fibonacci_numbers)
hypothesis.run(test_all_fibonacci_numbers_greater_than_1)
```
Note that the `hypothesis` module requires you to install the Hypothesis library before you can use it. You can install Hypothesis using the following command:
```
pip install hypothesis

def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
```
This code uses recursion to solve the problem. It uses the fact that the n-th Fibonacci number is the sum of the (n-1)-th and (n-2)-th Fibonacci numbers. The base case is when n is 1 or 2, in which case the answer is 1. For larger values of n, the code recursively calls itself with n-1 and n-2 as the inputs, and then adds the two results together to get the answer.

It's worth noting that this solution is not the most efficient way to solve the problem. A faster solution would be to use a dynamic programming approach, where you store the results of the previous calls to the function in a dictionary, so that you don't have to recalculate them each time you call the function again.</s>  ```
def fibonacci(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
```</s>  ```
def fibonacci(n):
    a, b = 0, 1
    for i in range(n):
        a, b = b, a + b
    return a
```</s>  ```
def fibonacci(n):
    a, b = 0, 1
    for i in range(n):
        a, b = b, a + b
    return a
```</s>  ```
def fibonacci(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
```
This code uses a recursive approach to calculate the n-th Fibonacci number. The base cases are when n=0 and n=1, where the result is 0 and 1 respectively. For larger values of n, the function calls itself with n-1 and n-2 as arguments, and returns the sum of the results.

This code is efficient because it avoids the creation of unnecessary intermediate values and uses the fact that the Fibonacci sequence is a recursive sequence. It also has a time complexity of O(n), which is optimal for this problem.</s>  ```
def fibonacci(n):
    a, b = 0, 1
    for i in range(n):
        a, b = b, a + b
    return a
```
This code uses a simple loop to generate the n-th Fibonacci number. The variable `a` keeps track of the previous Fibonacci number, and `b` keeps track of the current Fibonacci number. At each iteration, the value of `a` is updated to the value of `b`, and `b` is updated to the sum of `a` and `b`. The loop continues until `n` iterations have been completed, at which point `a` contains the n-th Fibonacci number.</s>  ```
def nth_fibonacci(n):
    a, b = 0, 1
    for i in range(n):
        a, b = b, a + b
    return a
```
Explanation:
The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers. The first two numbers in the series are 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two numbers.

The code above uses a loop to iterate over the range of numbers from 0 to n, and at each iteration, it adds the previous two numbers to get the current number. The variables a and b are used to store the previous two numbers, and the final result is returned at the end of the loop.

For example, if n is 5, the loop will iterate over the range of numbers from 0 to 5, and the variables a and b will be updated as follows:

* a = 0, b = 1 (initial values)
* a = 1, b = 1 + 0 = 1 (first iteration)
* a = 1, b = 1 + 1 = 2 (second iteration)
* a = 2, b = 2 + 1 = 3 (third iteration)
* a = 3, b = 3 + 2 = 5 (fourth iteration)
* a = 5, b = 5 + 3 = 8 (fifth iteration)

The final result is returned as 8.</s>  ```
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
```
This code uses a recursive approach to calculate the n-th Fibonacci number. The function has a base case of `n <= 1`, where it returns `n` directly. For larger values of `n`, it calls itself with `n-1` and `n-2` as arguments, and returns the sum of their results.

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(2^n), since each recursive call makes two function calls, and the number of recursive calls grows exponentially with the input `n`. However, the space complexity is O(1), since the function only requires a constant amount of memory to store the recursive calls.</s>  ```
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
```
This code uses the recursive definition of the Fibonacci sequence to calculate the n-th Fibonacci number. The base case is when n is 1 or 2, in which case the answer is the same as the input. For larger values of n, the function recursively calls itself with n-1 and n-2 as arguments, and then adds the results together to get the final answer.

Note that this code will produce a stack overflow error for large values of n, since the recursive calls will keep adding to the stack. To avoid this, you can use a loop instead of recursion, like this:
```
def fibonacci(n):
    a, b = 0, 1
    for i in range(n):
        a, b = b, a+b
    return a
```
This code uses a loop to calculate the n-th Fibonacci number. It starts with a and b initialized to 0 and 1, respectively. In each iteration of the loop, it adds a and b together to get a new value, which it then assigns to a. This process continues until the desired number of iterations have been completed, at which point a contains the n-th Fibonacci number.</s>  ```
def fibonacci(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
```
This code uses a recursive approach to calculate the n-th Fibonacci number. It checks if the input `n` is 0 or 1, and returns the corresponding values. Otherwise, it calls itself with `n-1` and `n-2` as arguments and adds the results to get the n-th Fibonacci number.</s>
