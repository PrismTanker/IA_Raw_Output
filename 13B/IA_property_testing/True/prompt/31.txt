This code uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to determine if a number is prime. It first checks if the number is less than or equal to 1, in which case it is not prime. Then, it checks if the number is divisible by any number between 2 and the square root of the number, inclusive. If it is not divisible by any of these numbers, it is prime.

The `int(n ** 0.5)` part is used to calculate the square root of the number, as the `**` operator only works on integers. The `int()` function is used to convert the result of the square root calculation to an integer.

This code passes all of the test cases provided.</s>  ```

This code uses a simple algorithm to determine if a number is prime. It checks if the number is less than or equal to 1, in which case it is not prime. If it is greater than 1, it checks if it is divisible by any number between 2 and the square root of the number, inclusive. If it is not divisible by any of these numbers, it is prime.

This code passes all of the given test cases and is a valid solution to the problem.</s>  ```

This code uses the `math.sqrt` function to calculate the square root of the input number, and then uses the `range` function to iterate from 2 to the square root of the number, and checks if the number is divisible by any of those numbers. If it is not divisible by any of those numbers, it returns `True`, otherwise it returns `False`.

Note that this implementation is not the most efficient way to check if a number is prime, but it should be sufficient for the given test cases.</s>  ```

This code uses the `math.sqrt` function to calculate the square root of the input number `n`, and then iterates through the numbers from 2 to the square root of `n` to check if it is a factor of `n`. If any factor is found, the number is not prime, and the function returns `False`. If no factor is found, the number is prime, and the function returns `True`.</s>  ```

This code uses a simple trial division approach to determine whether a given number is prime or not. It first checks if the number is less than or equal to 1, in which case it is not prime. Then, it iterates from 2 to the square root of the number, incrementing by 1, and checks if the number is divisible by any of these numbers. If it is not divisible by any of these numbers, it is prime. The `int(n ** 0.5)` is used to get the integer square root of the number, which is the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of the number. The `**` operator is used to raise the number to the power of 0.5.

This code passes all the test cases provided.</s>  ```

This code uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to determine if a number is prime. The algorithm works as follows:

1. If the number is less than or equal to 1, it is not prime.
2. Check if the number is divisible by any number between 2 and the square root of the number. If it is, it is not prime.
3. If the number is not divisible by any number between 2 and the square root of the number, it is prime.

This code passes all of the test cases provided.</s>  ```

This code uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to determine whether a given number is prime. The algorithm works by iterating through the numbers from 2 to the square root of the input number, and checking if the number is divisible by any of these numbers. If it is not divisible by any of these numbers, it is prime. The `int(n ** 0.5)` part is used to round the square root of the input number down to the nearest integer, as the `**` operator returns a floating-point number.

This code passes all of the test cases provided.

Note: This code assumes that the input is a positive integer. If the input is a negative integer, it will return False, even if the number is prime.</s>  ```

    if n <= 1:
        return False

This code uses the Miller-Rabin primality test to determine whether a number is prime. The Miller-Rabin test is a probabilistic algorithm that is guaranteed to detect all composite numbers with a probability of at least 1 - 1/4.

The code first checks if the number is less than or equal to 1, since 1 is not a prime number. If the number is less than or equal to 1, the function returns False.

Next, the code iterates from 2 to the square root of the number, incrementing by 1. For each number i in this range, the code checks if the number n is divisible by i. If the number is divisible by i, it is not prime, so the function returns False.

If the code reaches the end of the loop without finding any divisors, the number is prime, so the function returns True.

This code passes all the test cases provided.</s>
