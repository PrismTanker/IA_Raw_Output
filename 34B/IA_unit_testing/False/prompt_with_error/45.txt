Prompt: Given the two required lengths return area for a triangle.
-------------------
  Here is a test suite for the given problem:
```
{
    "test_area_1": {
        "in": {
            "length1": 3,
            "length2": 4
        },
        "out": 6
    },
    "test_area_2": {
        "in": {
            "length1": 5,
            "length2": 6
        },
        "out": 15
    },
    "test_area_3": {
        "in": {
            "length1": 7,
            "length2": 8
        },
        "out": 28
    }
}
```
This test suite includes three tests, each with the following structure:

* `in`: This section contains the input parameters for the test, with the names of the parameters and their corresponding values.
* `out`: This section contains the expected output for the test.

In this case, the input parameters are the two lengths of the triangle, and the output is the area of the triangle. The test suite includes three tests, each with different values for the input parameters, to ensure that the solution works correctly for a variety of inputs.</s>  ```
def triangle_area(base: float, height: float) -> float:
    return (base * height) / 2
```
Example:
```
>>> triangle_area(5, 6)
15.0
```</s>  ```
def get_triangle_area(base, height):
    return (base * height) / 2
```

This function takes in two arguments, `base` and `height`, which are the lengths of the base and height of the triangle, respectively. It returns the area of the triangle, which is calculated by multiplying the base and height and dividing by 2.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```
print(get_triangle_area(5, 6)) # Output: 15.0
```
This will output the area of the triangle with a base of 5 and a height of 6, which is 15.0.</s>  ```
def triangle_area(base, height):
    return (base * height) / 2
```
This function takes two arguments, `base` and `height`, which are the base and height of the triangle, respectively. It then calculates the area of the triangle using the formula `A = (base * height) / 2`. The result is returned as a float.

Here is an example of how to use the function:
```
print(triangle_area(5, 6))  # Output: 15.0
```
This will calculate the area of a triangle with a base of 5 and a height of 6, which is 15.0.</s>  ```
def triangle_area(base, height):
    return (base * height) / 2
```
This function takes in two arguments, `base` and `height`, which are the base and height of the triangle, respectively. The function calculates the area of the triangle by multiplying the base and height and dividing by 2.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```
print(triangle_area(5, 6))  # Output: 15.0
```
This code will output 15.0, which is the area of the triangle with a base of 5 and a height of 6.</s>  ```
def triangle_area(base, height):
    return (base * height) / 2
```</s>  ```
def triangle_area(base, height):
    return (base * height) / 2
```
This function takes two arguments, `base` and `height`, which are the lengths of the base and height of the triangle, respectively. The function calculates the area of the triangle by multiplying the base and height, and dividing the result by 2. The area is then returned.

Here is an example of how to use this function:
```
print(triangle_area(5, 6))  # Output: 15.0
```
This will calculate the area of a triangle with a base of 5 units and a height of 6 units, and print the result.</s>  ```
def triangle_area(base, height):
    return (base * height) / 2
```

This function takes in two arguments, `base` and `height`, which are the base and height of the triangle, respectively. It then returns the area of the triangle using the formula `A = (base * height) / 2`.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```
print(triangle_area(5, 6)) # Output: 15.0
```
This prints `15.0`, which is the area of the triangle with a base of 5 and a height of 6.</s>  ```
def triangle_area(base, height):
    return (base * height) / 2
```
This function takes in two parameters, `base` and `height`, which are the lengths of the sides of a triangle. It then calculates and returns the area of the triangle using the formula `A = (base * height) / 2`.

Here is an example of how to use this function:
```
print(triangle_area(5, 6)) # Output: 15.0
```</s>  ```
def triangle_area(base, height):
    return (base * height) / 2
```
Explanation:

The formula for the area of a triangle is:

A = (base * height) / 2

Where A is the area of the triangle, base is the length of one side of the triangle, and height is the length of the altitude to the base.

In this code, we use the formula to calculate the area of the triangle and return it as a float.</s>  ```
def triangle_area(base, height):
    return (base * height) / 2
```
This function takes two parameters, `base` and `height`, and returns the area of a triangle with the given base and height. The formula used is `A = (base * height) / 2`, where `A` is the area of the triangle.

Here is an example usage of the function:
```
print(triangle_area(3, 4))  # Output: 6.0
```
This will output the area of a triangle with a base of 3 units and a height of 4 units, which is 6 square units.</s>
