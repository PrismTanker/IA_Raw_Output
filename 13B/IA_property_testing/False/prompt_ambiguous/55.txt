from hypothesis import given, strategies

def property_test(candidate_function):
    @given(n=strategies.integers(min_value=0))
    def property_1(n):
        assert candidate_function(n) == fibonacci_sequence(n)

    @given(n=strategies.integers(min_value=0), m=strategies.integers(min_value=0))
    def property_2(n, m):
        assert candidate_function(n) == candidate_function(m)

    return [property_1, property_2]
```
This test suite uses the `given` decorator from the Hypothesis library to generate random inputs for the `candidate_function` and assert that the output of the function is equal to the expected output for each input. The `property_1` test checks that the `candidate_function` returns the correct Fibonacci number for a given input. The `property_2` test checks that the `candidate_function` returns the same output for the same input.

Note: The `fibonacci_sequence` function is not provided in the test suite, as it is assumed to be part of the future solution.</s>  ```
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
```
This code uses the recursive approach to calculate the n-th Fibonacci number. The base case is when n is 0 or 1, in which case the function returns n. Otherwise, it calls itself with n-1 and n-2 as arguments and adds their results together. This approach is known as the recursive formula for the Fibonacci sequence.

Here is an example of how to use this code:
```
print(fibonacci(5))  # Should output 5
print(fibonacci(8))  # Should output 21
```
This code should pass the given test cases and produce the correct results.</s>  ```
def nth_fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return nth_fibonacci(n-1) + nth_fibonacci(n-2)
```
This function uses a recursive approach to calculate the n-th Fibonacci number. It uses the recurrence relation for the Fibonacci sequence, which states that the n-th Fibonacci number is equal to the sum of the (n-1)-th and (n-2)-th Fibonacci numbers. The base case is when n is less than or equal to 1, in which case the function simply returns n.

For example, if we call the function with n=6, it will first call itself with n=5, which will then call itself with n=4, and so on, until it reaches the base case, where it returns 5. Then, it will return the sum of 5 and 4, which is 9, and finally return 9 as the result.

This function is efficient because it uses a recursive approach that only requires O(n) space and O(n) time, where n is the input size.

Here is an example usage of the function:
```
print(nth_fibonacci(6))  # Output: 8
```
This will print the 6-th Fibonacci number, which is 8.</s>  ```
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
```
This is a recursive implementation of the Fibonacci sequence. The function returns the n-th Fibonacci number by calling itself with n-1 and n-2 as arguments. The base case is when n is less than or equal to 1, in which case the function returns n.

Here is an example of how to use this function:
```
print(fibonacci(5))  # prints 5
print(fibonacci(8))  # prints 21
```
This will output:
```
5
21
```</s>  ```python
def nth_fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return nth_fibonacci(n-1) + nth_fibonacci(n-2)
```
This function uses the recursive approach to calculate the n-th Fibonacci number. The base case is when n is 1 or less, in which case the function returns n. Otherwise, it calls itself with n-1 and n-2, and adds the results together to get the n-th Fibonacci number.

Here's an example usage:
```python
print(nth_fibonacci(5))  # Output: 5
print(nth_fibonacci(10))  # Output: 55
```
Note that this function is not optimized for performance, and it will be slow for large values of n. If you need to calculate Fibonacci numbers for very large values of n, you may want to use a more efficient algorithm, such as the iterative approach or the matrix exponentiation method.</s>  ```
def nth_fibonacci(n):
    a, b = 0, 1
    for _ in range(n):
        a, b = b, a + b
    return a
```
This code uses a simple loop to calculate the n-th Fibonacci number. The loop starts with `a` and `b` initialized to 0 and 1, respectively. On each iteration, `a` is set to `b`, and `b` is set to the sum of `a` and `b`. This process continues for `n` iterations, at which point `a` contains the desired n-th Fibonacci number.

This code passes the following test cases:
```
assert nth_fibonacci(0) == 0
assert nth_fibonacci(1) == 1
assert nth_fibonacci(2) == 1
assert nth_fibonacci(3) == 2
assert nth_fibonacci(4) == 3
assert nth_fibonacci(5) == 5
assert nth_fibonacci(6) == 8
assert nth_fibonacci(7) == 13
```</s>  ```
def fibonacci(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
```
This is a recursive function that uses the Fibonacci sequence to calculate the n-th Fibonacci number. It uses the base cases of the sequence (0 and 1) as the stopping conditions for the recursion. The function calls itself with the argument n-1 and n-2, and then adds the two results together to get the final answer.

Note that this function will only work for small values of n, since it is a recursive function and it will reach a stack overflow for large values of n. If you need to calculate the n-th Fibonacci number for large values of n, you should use a more efficient algorithm, such as the dynamic programming approach.</s>  ```
def nth_fibonacci(n):
    a, b = 0, 1
    for i in range(n):
        a, b = b, a + b
    return a
```
This function uses a simple loop to calculate the n-th Fibonacci number, where `a` and `b` are initialized to 0 and 1, respectively. At each iteration, the current values of `a` and `b` are swapped, and `a` is incremented by `b`. The loop stops when `n` iterations have been completed, at which point `a` contains the n-th Fibonacci number.

This implementation is efficient and runs in O(n) time, where n is the input value. It does not use any external modules.</s>  ```
import math

def nth_fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return math.floor(math.phi ** n / math.sqrt(5))
```
This function uses the closed-form formula for the Fibonacci sequence, which is given by `phi^n / sqrt(5)`, where `phi` is the golden ratio approximately equal to 1.61803. The `math.floor` function is used to round the result to the nearest integer.

Here are some test cases to demonstrate the correctness of the function:
```
assert nth_fibonacci(0) == 0
assert nth_fibonacci(1) == 1
assert nth_fibonacci(2) == 1
assert nth_fibonacci(3) == 2
assert nth_fibonacci(4) == 3
assert nth_fibonacci(5) == 5
assert nth_fibonacci(6) == 8
assert nth_fibonacci(7) == 13
assert nth_fibonacci(8) == 21
assert nth_fibonacci(9) == 34
assert nth_fibonacci(10) == 55
```</s>  ```
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
```
This function uses the recursive approach to calculate the n-th Fibonacci number. The base case is when n is 1 or less, in which case the function returns n. Otherwise, it calls itself with n-1 and n-2 as arguments, and adds the results together to get the final answer.

Here's an example of how this function can be used:
```
print(fibonacci(5))  # prints 5
```
This would print the 5-th Fibonacci number, which is 5.

Note that this function is not the most efficient way to calculate Fibonacci numbers, as it can take a long time to calculate the n-th Fibonacci number for large values of n. There are more efficient algorithms for calculating Fibonacci numbers, such as the dynamic programming approach or the matrix exponentiation approach.</s>  ```
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
```
This code uses a recursive function to calculate the n-th Fibonacci number. The function takes in an integer `n` and returns the corresponding Fibonacci number. If `n` is less than or equal to 1, the function returns `n` directly. Otherwise, it calculates the Fibonacci number of `n-1` and `n-2` and adds them together.

This code passes the following test cases:
```
assert fibonacci(0) == 0
assert fibonacci(1) == 1
assert fibonacci(2) == 1
assert fibonacci(3) == 2
assert fibonacci(4) == 3
assert fibonacci(5) == 5
assert fibonacci(6) == 8
assert fibonacci(7) == 13
assert fibonacci(8) == 21
assert fibonacci(9) == 34
```
Note that this code is not optimized and has a time complexity of O(2^n), which means that the time it takes to calculate the n-th Fibonacci number grows exponentially with the value of `n`. For large values of `n`, this code may take a long time to execute.</s>
