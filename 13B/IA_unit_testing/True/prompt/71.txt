    Given the lengths of the three sides of a triangle. Return the area of
    the triangle rounded to 2 decimal points if the three sides form a valid triangle. 
    Otherwise return -1
    Three sides make a valid triangle when the sum of any two sides is greater 
    than the third side.
    Example:
    triangle_area(3, 4, 5) == 6.00
    triangle_area(1, 2, 10) == -1

This test suite contains three tests: "valid_triangle", "invalid_triangle_1", and "invalid_triangle_2". Each test has two inputs: "in" and "out". The "in" input contains the lengths of the three sides of the triangle, while the "out" input contains the expected output for that test case. The test cases are designed to cover different scenarios, including valid and invalid triangles, and different lengths for the three sides. The output for each test case is compared to the expected output, and if they match, the test is considered successful.</s>

This code uses the Heron's formula to calculate the area of the triangle. It first checks if the three sides form a valid triangle by using the triangle inequality theorem, which states that the sum of any two sides of a triangle is always greater than the third side. If the sides do not form a valid triangle, it returns -1. Otherwise, it calculates the area of the triangle using Heron's formula and rounds it to 2 decimal points.</s>  ```

This code uses the Heron's formula to calculate the area of a triangle. The formula is given by:

area = sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c))

where s is the semiperimeter of the triangle, which is half of the sum of the lengths of all sides.

The code first checks if the three sides form a valid triangle by using the triangle inequality theorem. If the three sides form a valid triangle, the code calculates the area using the Heron's formula and returns the result rounded to 2 decimal points. If the three sides do not form a valid triangle, the code returns -1.</s>  ```
def triangle_area(a, b, c):
    if a + b > c and b + c > a and a + c > b:
        s = (a + b + c) / 2
        area = (s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c)) ** 0.5

    else:

```
This code first checks if the three sides form a valid triangle using the triangle inequality theorem. If the sides form a valid triangle, it calculates the semi-perimeter s and the area of the triangle using the formula for the area of a triangle. Finally, it rounds the area to 2 decimal points and returns it. If the sides do not form a valid triangle, it returns -1.

Note: The `** 0.5` is used to calculate the square root of the area, since the formula for the area of a triangle gives the square of the area. The `round` function is used to round the result to 2 decimal points.</s>  ```

This function uses the Heron's formula to calculate the area of the triangle. The formula is:

A = sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c))

Where s is half the perimeter of the triangle, and a, b, and c are the lengths of the sides.

The function first checks if the three sides form a valid triangle by using the triangle inequality theorem. If they do, it calculates the area using the formula and rounds it to 2 decimal points. If the sides don't form a valid triangle, it returns -1.

Note that this function uses the `math` module to perform the square root operation.</s>  ```

This code uses the Heron's formula to calculate the area of a triangle. The formula is `area = sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c))`, where `s` is the semiperimeter of the triangle, which is half the sum of the lengths of the three sides. The code first checks if the three sides form a valid triangle by using the triangle inequality theorem, and then calculates the area using the formula. Finally, it rounds the result to 2 decimal points and returns it. If the triangle is not valid, it returns -1.</s>
