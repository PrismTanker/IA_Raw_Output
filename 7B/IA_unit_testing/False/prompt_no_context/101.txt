Prompt: 
    You will be given a string of words separated by commas or spaces. Your task is
    to split the string into words and return an array of the words.
    
    For example:
    words_string("Hi, my name is John") == ["Hi", "my", "name", "is", "John"]
    words_string("One, two, three, four, five, six") == ["One", "two", "three", "four", "five", "six"]
    
-------------------
  Here is a sample test suite for the problem you described:
```
{
  "split_string": {
    "in": {
      "string": "Hi, my name is John"
    },
    "out": ["Hi", "my", "name", "is", "John"]
  },
  "split_string_with_spaces": {
    "in": {
      "string": "One two three four five six"
    },
    "out": ["One", "two", "three", "four", "five", "six"]
  },
  "split_string_with_multiple_spaces": {
    "in": {
      "string": "One   two three four five six"
    },
    "out": ["One", "two", "three", "four", "five", "six"]
  },
  "split_string_with_commas_and_spaces": {
    "in": {
      "string": "One, two, three, four, five, six"
    },
    "out": ["One", "two", "three", "four", "five", "six"]
  },
  "split_string_with_commas_and_multiple_spaces": {
    "in": {
      "string": "One,   two, three, four, five, six"
    },
    "out": ["One", "two", "three", "four", "five", "six"]
  },
  "split_string_with_spaces_and_commas": {
    "in": {
      "string": "One two, three, four, five, six"
    },
    "out": ["One", "two", "three", "four", "five", "six"]
  },
  "split_string_with_multiple_commas": {
    "in": {
      "string": "One, two, three,, four, five, six"
    },
    "out": ["One", "two", "three", "four", "five", "six"]
  },
  "split_string_with_multiple_spaces_and_commas": {
    "in": {
      "string": "One,   two, three,, four, five, six"
    },
    "out": ["One", "two", "three", "four", "five", "six"]
  }
}
```
This test suite includes a variety of inputs that cover different scenarios, such as:

* Strings with commas and spaces
* Strings with multiple commas
* Strings with multiple spaces
* Strings with both commas and spaces
* Strings with only commas
* Strings with only spaces

For each input, the test suite provides a set of expected outputs, which are the arrays of words that the function should return when given that input.</s>  ```
def words_string(string):
    return string.split()
```</s>  ```
def words_string(string):
    import re
    return re.split(r'\W+', string)
```
This code uses the `re` module to split the string into words using a regular expression that matches one or more non-word characters (`\W+`). The `re.split()` function returns a list of the words in the string.</s>  ```
def words_string(string):
    return string.split(", ")
```
This code uses the `split()` method of the string object to split the input string into a list of words. The `split()` method takes an argument, which is the separator, in this case a comma and a space. The method returns a list of words.</s>  ```
    def words_string(string):
        return string.split(", ")
    ```</s>  Sure! Here's a Python code sample that solves this problem:
```
def words_string(string):
    return string.split(",") + string.split(" ")
```
This code uses the `split()` method of the `string` class to split the input string into words based on either commas or spaces. The `+` operator is used to concatenate the resulting lists of words.

Note that this code assumes that the input string is a single string, and that the words are separated by either commas or spaces. If the input string contains other types of characters or if the words are separated by a different delimiter, you may need to modify the code accordingly.</s>  Sure! Here is a Python code sample that solves the problem you described:
```
def words_string(input_string):
    # Split the input string into a list of words using the split() method
    words = input_string.split()
    # Return the list of words
    return words
```
This code uses the `split()` method of the `str` class to split the input string into a list of words, and then returns the list of words.

Note that this code assumes that the input string is a single string that contains a sequence of words separated by commas or spaces. If the input string is a list of words, you will need to use a different approach to split the list into individual words.</s>  Here is a possible Python solution to the problem:
```
def words_string(string):
    import re
    return re.split(r'\W+', string)
```
This solution uses the `re` module in Python to split the input string into words based on one or more non-word characters (such as commas, spaces, or punctuation). The `r'\W+'` regular expression pattern matches one or more non-word characters, and the `re.split()` function splits the input string into a list of words based on these matches.

For example, if the input string is "Hi, my name is John", the `words_string()` function would return the list `["Hi", "my", "name", "is", "John"]`.

Note that this solution assumes that the input string may contain spaces or other whitespace characters, and that these should be removed from the words in the output array. If the input string may contain commas or other punctuation, you may need to modify the regular expression pattern to match those characters as well.</s>  Here is the code sample:
```
def words_string(string):
    return string.split()
```
This code uses the `split()` method of the string object to split the string into a list of words. The `split()` method takes an optional argument that specifies the separator to use for splitting the string. In this case, the separator is set to a space or a comma, which is why the method works for both examples.</s>  ```
    def words_string(string):
        return string.split()
    ```
This code uses the split() method of the string class to split the input string into a list of words. The split() method takes an optional argument, which is the separator to use for the split. In this case, we are using the default separator, which is a space, so the method will split the input string into a list of words based on spaces.</s>  ```
def words_string(string):
    return string.split(", ")
    ```
This code uses the `split()` method to split the string into words based on the commas and spaces. The `split()` method returns a list of words, which is then returned by the function.</s>
