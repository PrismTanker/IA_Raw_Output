}</s>  Here's a sample JSON test suite for the "Add two numbers" problem:
```
{
  "add_two_numbers": {
    "in": {
      "num1": 2,
      "num2": 3
    },
    "out": 5
  },

    },
    "out": 1
  },
  "add_two_numbers_positive_negative": {

  "add_two_numbers_large_numbers": {
    "in": {

    },

  }
}
```
This test suite includes six test cases:

1. `add_two_numbers`: This test case tests the addition of two positive numbers. The input is `num1 = 2` and `num2 = 3`, and the expected output is `5`.
2. `add_two_numbers_negative`: This test case tests the addition of two negative numbers. The input is `num1 = -2` and `num2 = -3`, and the expected output is `-5`.
3. `add_two_numbers_negative_positive`: This test case tests the addition of a negative and a positive number. The input is `num1 = -2` and `num2 = 3`, and the expected output is `1`.
4. `add_two_numbers_positive_negative`: This test case tests the addition of a positive and a negative number. The input is `num1 = 2` and `num2 = -3`, and the expected output is `-1`.
5. `add_two_numbers_zero`: This test case tests the addition of two zeroes. The input is `num1 = 0` and `num2 = 0`, and the expected output is `0`.
6. `add_two_numbers_large_numbers`: This test case tests the addition of two large numbers. The input is `num1 = 1000000000` and `num2 = 1000000000`, and the expected output is `2000000000`.

Note that the inputs and expected outputs are represented in JSON format, where `num1` and `num2` are the two numbers to be added, and `out` is the expected result of the addition.</s>  To add two numbers in Python, you can use the `+` operator. For example:
```
a = 5
b = 3
c = a + b
print(c)
```
This will output `8`, which is the sum of `5` and `3`.

Alternatively, you can use the `sum` function to add two or more numbers. For example:
```
a = 5
b = 3
c = sum(a, b)
print(c)
```
This will also output `8`, which is the sum of `5` and `3`.

You can also use the `+=` operator to add two numbers and assign the result to a variable. For example:
```
a = 5
b = 3
a += b
print(a)
```
This will output `8`, which is the sum of `5` and `3`.

Note that you can also use other arithmetic operators such as `-` (subtraction), `*` (multiplication), `/` (division), and `%` (modulus) to perform arithmetic operations on numbers in Python.</s>  ```
def add(a, b):
    return a + b
```</s>  ```
def add_numbers(num1, num2):
    return num1 + num2
```</s>  ```
def add_two_numbers(num1, num2):
    return num1 + num2
```
This function takes two numbers as arguments and returns their sum. It does not use any modules, so it should be compatible with any version of Python.</s>  ```
def add(a, b):
    return a + b
```</s>  ```
def add(num1, num2):
    return num1 + num2
```
This code sample uses the built-in addition operator to add two numbers. The `return` statement is used to return the result of the addition.</s>  ```
def add_numbers(num1, num2):
    return num1 + num2
```</s>  ```
def add_numbers(num1, num2):
    return num1 + num2
```
This code defines a function called `add_numbers` that takes two arguments `num1` and `num2`. The function uses the basic arithmetic operator `+` to add the two numbers and returns the result.

Note that this code does not include any error handling or input validation, so it is important to make sure that the inputs are valid and of the correct type before passing them to this function.</s>  ```
def add(a, b):
    return a + b
```</s>  ```
def add_numbers(num1, num2):
    return num1 + num2
```</s>
