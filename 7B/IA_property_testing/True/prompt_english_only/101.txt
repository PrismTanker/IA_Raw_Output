Prompt: You will be given a string of words separated by commas or spaces. Your task is
    to split the string into words and return an array of the words.
-------------------
  Here is a test suite that uses the Hypothesis library to write property tests for a function that splits a string into words:
```
from hypothesis import given, strategies

def property_test(candidate_function) -> None:

    @given(strategies.text())
    def property_1(text: str) -> None:
        words = candidate_function(text)
        assert isinstance(words, list)
        for word in words:
            assert isinstance(word, str)

    @given(strategies.text())
    def property_2(text: str) -> None:
        words = candidate_function(text)
        assert all(isinstance(word, str) for word in words)

    @given(strategies.text())
    def property_3(text: str) -> None:
        words = candidate_function(text)
        assert words == text.split()

    return [property_1, property_2, property_3]
```
This test suite defines three property tests for the `candidate_function`:

1. `property_1`: The function should return a list of strings.
2. `property_2`: The function should return a list of strings where each string is a word in the input text.
3. `property_3`: The function should return the same list of words as the `text.split()` method.

To use this test suite, you would pass the `candidate_function` to the `property_test` function and it would return a list of property tests. For example:
```
def solution(text: str) -> list[str]:
    # Your solution here
    return text.split()

property_tests = property_test(solution)
for test in property_tests:
    test()
```
This would run the three property tests on the `solution` function and ensure that it meets the requirements of the problem.</s>  ```
import re

def split_words(string):
    words = re.split(r'[,\s]+', string)
    return words
```
Explanation:

* The `re` module is imported for regular expression operations.
* The `re.split()` function is used to split the input string into words based on one or more delimiters, which in this case are commas and spaces.
* The `r'[,\s]+'` regular expression pattern matches one or more occurrences of either a comma or a whitespace character.
* The `return` statement returns the list of words as the result of the function.

Test cases:
```
# Test case 1:
string = "hello,world,python"
result = split_words(string)
print(result) # Output: ['hello', 'world', 'python']

# Test case 2:
string = "hello world python"
result = split_words(string)
print(result) # Output: ['hello', 'world', 'python']

# Test case 3:
string = "hello,world python"
result = split_words(string)
print(result) # Output: ['hello', 'world', 'python']
```</s>  ```
def split_words(string):
    import re
    words = re.split(r'[,\s]+', string)
    return words
```
This code uses the `re` module's `split()` function to split the string into words based on either commas or spaces. The `r'[,\s]+'` regular expression matches one or more of either a comma or a whitespace character, and the `split()` function splits the input string using this regular expression. The resulting array of words is then returned.</s>  ```
def split_words(string):
    return string.split()
```
Explanation:

The `split()` method is used to split a string into a list of substrings, using a specified separator. In this case, we are using the default separator of any whitespace characters (spaces, tabs, and line breaks). The `split()` method returns a list of the words in the string, without any punctuation or special characters.

For example, if we have the following string:

```
"Hello, World! How are you today?"
```

The `split()` method would return the following list:

```
["Hello", "World!", "How", "are", "you", "today?"]
```

Note that the separator can be changed to any other character or combination of characters that you want to use. For example, if you want to split the string using a comma, you can use the following code:

```
def split_words(string):
    return string.split(",")
```

This would return a list of the words in the string, separated by commas:

```
["Hello", "World!", "How", "are", "you", "today?"]
```

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.</s>
