This test suite will generate two property tests for the `candidate_function`, `property_1` and `property_2`.

`property_1` will test the case where the three sides do not form a valid triangle, and `property_2` will test the case where the three sides form a valid triangle.

The test suite will use the `hypothesis` library to generate random integers as the lengths of the three sides of the triangle, and will use the `@given` decorator to specify the parameters of the function to be tested.

The test suite will then use the `assert` statement to check that the output of the `candidate_function` is equal to 0 when the three sides do not form a valid triangle, and is equal to the rounded area of the triangle when the three sides form a valid triangle.

This test suite will ensure that the `candidate_function` is correct for all possible input values, and will catch any errors or bugs in the implementation.</s>  ```

This code defines a function `get_triangle_area` that takes three sides `a`, `b`, and `c` as input. It checks if the three sides form a valid triangle by checking if the sum of any two sides is greater than the third side. If the sides form a valid triangle, the function calculates the area of the triangle using the formula for the area of a triangle and rounds it to 2 decimal points. If the sides do not form a valid triangle, the function returns 0.

Here are some test cases:
```
print(get_triangle_area(3, 4, 5))  # Should print 6.0
print(get_triangle_area(5, 12, 13))  # Should print 0.0
print(get_triangle_area(3, 4, 5))  # Should print 0.0
```
Note: The `round()` function is used to round the area to 2 decimal points. The `0.5` multiplier is used to account for the fact that the formula for the area of a triangle returns the area in units of half the base times the height.</s>  ```

This code uses the Heron's formula to calculate the area of the triangle. It first checks if the three sides form a valid triangle by checking if the sum of any two sides is greater than the third side. If the sides form a valid triangle, the code calculates the area using the Heron's formula and rounds it to 2 decimal points. Otherwise, it returns 0.</s>  ```

This code uses the `math.sqrt()` function from the `math` module to calculate the area of the triangle. It first checks if the three sides form a valid triangle by using the triangle inequality theorem, and if they do, it calculates the area using the formula for the area of a triangle. Finally, it rounds the area to 2 decimal points and returns it. If the three sides do not form a valid triangle, it returns 0.

Note that the `round()` function is used to round the area to 2 decimal points, and the `math.sqrt()` function is used to calculate the square root of the area.

Also, the `math` module is imported to use its functions for calculation.

This code uses the Heron's formula to calculate the area of a triangle if the three sides form a valid triangle, and returns 0 otherwise. The formula is:

Area = sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c))

where s is the semiperimeter of the triangle, which is (a + b + c) / 2. The formula is only valid if the three sides form a valid triangle, which means that the sum of any two sides is greater than the third side.

The `math.sqrt()` function is used to calculate the square root of the expression, and the `round()` function is used to round the result to 2 decimal points.</s>  ```

    if is_valid_triangle(a, b, c):

def is_valid_triangle(a, b, c):

```
This code uses the Heron's formula to calculate the area of a triangle. The `is_valid_triangle` function checks if the three sides form a valid triangle by using the condition that the sum of any two sides is greater than the third side. If the sides form a valid triangle, the function returns `True`, otherwise it returns `False`. The `get_triangle_area` function first calls the `is_valid_triangle` function to check if the sides form a valid triangle, and if they do, it calculates the area using the Heron's formula. Finally, it rounds the area to 2 decimal points and returns it.</s>  ```

```
This code uses the Heron's formula to calculate the area of the triangle if the three sides form a valid triangle. The formula is:

A = sqrt(s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c))

where s = (a + b + c) / 2

The function first checks if the three sides form a valid triangle by checking if the sum of any two sides is greater than the third side. If the sides do not form a valid triangle, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it calculates the area of the triangle using the formula and rounds it to 2 decimal points.

Note that the `math.sqrt()` function is used to calculate the square root of a number, and the `round()` function is used to round a number to a specified number of decimal points.

You can test this code with the following examples:
```
print(get_triangle_area(3, 4, 5))  # should return 6.0
print(get_triangle_area(1, 2, 3))  # should return 0.0
```</s>  ```
def get_triangle_area(a, b, c):
    if a + b > c and b + c > a and a + c > b:

    else:
        return 0
```
This function takes in three side lengths, checks if they form a valid triangle, and if so, returns the area of the triangle rounded to 2 decimal points. If the sides do not form a valid triangle, it returns 0.

The function uses the formula for the area of a triangle, which is (1/2)ab \* sin(C), where a, b, and c are the lengths of the sides of the triangle, and C is the angle between them. The formula is simplified by using the fact that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, which means that sin(C) = (a^2 + b^2 - c^2) / 2ab.

The function first checks if the three sides form a valid triangle by using the sum of any two sides being greater than the third side. If this is not the case, the function returns 0. If the sides do form a valid triangle, the function calculates the area using the formula and returns it rounded to 2 decimal points.

The function can be tested with the following code:
```
print(get_triangle_area(3, 4, 5))  # should be 6.0
print(get_triangle_area(1, 1, 3))  # should be 0.0
print(get_triangle_area(5, 4, 6))  # should be 12.0
```
The first test case should return 6.0, since 3 + 4 > 5. The second test case should return 0.0, since 1 + 1 > 3. The third test case should return 12.0, since 5 + 4 > 6.</s>  ```

The formula is `area = sqrt(p * (p - a) * (p - b) * (p - c))`, where `p` is the perimeter of the triangle, which is calculated as `(a + b + c) / 2`. The `round` function is used to round the result to 2 decimal points. If the three sides do not form a valid triangle, the function returns 0.
