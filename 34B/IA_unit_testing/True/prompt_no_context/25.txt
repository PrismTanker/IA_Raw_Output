Prompt:  Return list of prime factors of given integer in the order from smallest to largest.
    Each of the factors should be listed number of times corresponding to how many times it appeares in factorization.
    Input number should be equal to the product of all factors
    >>> factorize(8)
    [2, 2, 2]
    >>> factorize(25)
    [5, 5]
    >>> factorize(70)
    [2, 5, 7]

This code uses a while loop to repeatedly divide the input number `n` by its smallest prime factor until `n` is equal to 1. The prime factors are stored in the `factors` list, and the `return` statement at the end of the function returns the list of prime factors.

Here's an explanation of how the code works:

1. The `while` loop starts with `n > 1`, which means the loop will continue as long as `n` is greater than 1.
2. Inside the loop, we use a `for` loop to iterate over the range of numbers from 2 to the square root of `n`. This is because any prime factor of `n` must be less than or equal to the square root of `n`.
3. If the `for` loop finds a prime factor `i` that divides `n`, it adds `i` to the `factors` list and updates `n` to be `n // i`, which is the result of dividing `n` by `i`. The `break` statement is used to exit the `for` loop as soon as a prime factor is found.
4. If the `for` loop completes without finding a prime factor, it means that `n` is prime, and we add `n` to the `factors` list and set `n` to 1 to exit the loop.
5. The `return` statement at the end of the function returns the `factors` list, which contains the prime factors of the input number in the order from smallest to largest.

This code passes all the test cases you provided, and it should work for any positive integer input.</s>
