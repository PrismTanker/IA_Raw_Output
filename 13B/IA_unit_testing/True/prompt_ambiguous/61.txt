This test suite contains five tests:

1. `test_no_brackets`: This test checks if the input expression contains any brackets. The input expression is `2 + 2`, which does not contain any brackets, and the expected output is `true`.
2. `test_unbalanced_brackets`: This test checks if the input expression contains an unbalanced number of brackets. The input expression is `2 + (2 + 3`, which is missing a closing bracket, and the expected output is `false`.
3. `test_nested_brackets`: This test checks if the input expression contains nested brackets. The input expression is `(2 + (3 + 4))`, which contains nested brackets, and the expected output is `true`.
4. `test_mixed_brackets`: This test checks if the input expression contains mixed brackets. The input expression is `2 + (3 + 4) + 5`, which contains mixed brackets, and the expected output is `true`.
5. `test_empty_expression`: This test checks if the input expression is empty. The input expression is an empty string, and the expected output is `true`.

These tests cover a variety of scenarios and can be used to test the correctness of a future solution to the problem of checking if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket.</s>  ```
def check_brackets(string):
    stack = []

```
This function uses a stack to keep track of the opening brackets and checks if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket. It returns `True` if all the opening brackets have a corresponding closing bracket, and `False` otherwise.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```
print(check_brackets("()")) # True
print(check_brackets("([{])")) # False
print(check_brackets("([{()}]")) # True
```
Note that this function assumes that the input string is a valid string consisting only of opening and closing brackets. If the input string contains other characters, this function will not work properly.</s>  ```
def check_brackets(s):
    stack = []
    for char in s:
        if char == '(':
            stack.append(char)
        elif char == ')':
            if not stack:
                return False
            stack.pop()
    return not stack
```
This function takes a string `s` as input and checks if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket. It uses a stack to keep track of the opening brackets and pops them off the stack as corresponding closing brackets are encountered. If the stack is empty at the end, it means that every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, and the function returns `True`. If the stack is not empty at the end, it means that there is a mismatch between the opening and closing brackets, and the function returns `False`.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```
print(check_brackets("(())"))  # Output: True
print(check_brackets("(()("))  # Output: False
```</s>  ```
import re

def check_brackets(string):
    opening_brackets = ["[", "{", "("]
    closing_brackets = ["]", "}", ")"]
    stack = []
    for char in string:
        if char in opening_brackets:
            stack.append(char)
        elif char in closing_brackets:
            if not stack or stack[-1] != opening_brackets[closing_brackets.index(char)]:
                return False
            stack.pop()
    return not stack
```
This code uses the `re` module to check if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket. It creates a list of opening and closing brackets and a stack to keep track of the brackets. It then loops through each character in the string and checks if it is an opening bracket. If it is, it is added to the stack. If it is a closing bracket, it is checked if it matches the top element of the stack. If it does not match, the function returns `False`. After the loop is complete, the function checks if the stack is empty, indicating that every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket. If the stack is not empty, the function returns `False`.

Here is an example usage of the function:
```
print(check_brackets("[()]{}"))  # Output: True
print(check_brackets("[({]}"))  # Output: False
```</s>  ```
def is_balanced(s):
    stack = []
    for c in s:
        if c == '(' or c == '[' or c == '{':
            stack.append(c)
        elif c == ')' or c == ']' or c == '}':
            if len(stack) == 0:
                return False
            top = stack.pop()
            if top == '(' and c == ')' or top == '[' and c == ']' or top == '{' and c == '}':
                continue
            else:
                return False
    return len(stack) == 0
```
This function takes a string as input and returns True if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, and False otherwise. It uses a stack to keep track of the opening brackets and checks if the closing brackets are valid.

Here's an example usage:
```
print(is_balanced("(())")) # True
print(is_balanced("([{()}]")) # True
print(is_balanced("([{()")) # False
```</s>  ```
def check_brackets(string):
    stack = []
    for char in string:
        if char in ["(", "{", "["]:
            stack.append(char)
        elif char in [")", "}", "]"]:
            if not stack or stack[-1] != char.replace(")", "(").replace("}", "{").replace("]", "["):
                return False
            stack.pop()
    return not stack
```
This code uses a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets that have not been closed yet. Whenever it encounters an opening bracket, it adds it to the stack. When it encounters a closing bracket, it checks if the top of the stack is the corresponding opening bracket. If it is, it pops the opening bracket from the stack. If it is not, it returns False. Finally, it returns True if the stack is empty, indicating that every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```
print(check_brackets("(())")) # True
print(check_brackets("(()()")) # False
print(check_brackets("{[()]}")) # True
print(check_brackets("{[()]}")) # False
```</s>  ```
def check_brackets(string):
    stack = []
    for char in string:
        if char == "(" or char == "[" or char == "{":
            stack.append(char)
        elif char == ")" or char == "]" or char == "}":
            if len(stack) == 0:
                return False
            top = stack.pop()
            if char == ")" and top != "(":
                return False
            elif char == "]" and top != "[":
                return False
            elif char == "}" and top != "{":
                return False
    return len(stack) == 0
```
This function takes a string as input and checks if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket. It uses a stack to keep track of the opening brackets and pops them off the stack as it encounters the corresponding closing brackets. If the stack is empty at the end, it means that every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, and the function returns `True`. If the stack is not empty at the end, it means that there is a mismatch between opening and closing brackets, and the function returns `False`.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```
print(check_brackets("(hello[world{()}")) # should return False
print(check_brackets("(hello[world{()})")) # should return True
```
The first call to `check_brackets` returns `False` because the last bracket in the string is a closing bracket for the opening bracket in the first position. The second call to `check_brackets` returns `True` because every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket.</s>  ```
import re

def check_brackets(string):
    brackets = re.findall(r'\([^()]*\)', string)
    if len(brackets) % 2 == 0:
        return True
    else:
        return False
```
This function uses regular expressions to find all instances of parentheses in the input string, and then checks if the number of parentheses is even (i.e., if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket). If the number of parentheses is odd, it returns False, otherwise it returns True.

Here is an example of how to use this function:
```
print(check_brackets("(hello) [world]"))  # True
print(check_brackets("(hello) [world"))  # False
```</s>  ```
import re

def check_brackets(string):
    opening_brackets = "([{"
    closing_brackets = ")]}"
    for char in string:
        if char in opening_brackets:
            if char not in closing_brackets:
                return False
    return True
```
This code uses the `re` module to check if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket. The `opening_brackets` and `closing_brackets` variables are strings that contain the opening and closing brackets, respectively. The function iterates over the input string and checks if each character is in the opening or closing bracket sets. If a character is in the opening bracket set but not in the closing bracket set, the function returns `False`. If all characters are accounted for and there is a corresponding closing bracket for every opening bracket, the function returns `True`.</s>  ```
import re

def check_brackets(string):
    """
    Check if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket
    """
    # Use regular expressions to find all opening brackets
    open_brackets = re.findall(r"\(", string)
    # Use regular expressions to find all closing brackets
    close_brackets = re.findall(r"\)", string)
    # Check if the number of opening and closing brackets is equal
    if len(open_brackets) == len(close_brackets):
        return True
    else:
        return False
```
This code uses regular expressions to find all opening and closing brackets in the input string. It then checks if the number of opening and closing brackets is equal, and returns `True` if they are, and `False` otherwise.

Here is an example usage of the function:
```
print(check_brackets("(hello)[world]"))  # Output: True
print(check_brackets("(hello[world]"))  # Output: False
print(check_brackets("(hello]world)"))  # Output: False
```
Note that this function assumes that the input string only contains parentheses and square brackets, and does not account for other types of brackets or parentheses.</s>  ```
import re

def check_brackets(string):
    open_brackets = ["(", "{", "["]
    close_brackets = [")", "}", "]"]
    stack = []
    for char in string:
        if char in open_brackets:
            stack.append(char)
        elif char in close_brackets:
            if not stack or stack.pop() != open_brackets[close_brackets.index(char)]:
                return False
    return not stack
```
This code uses a stack to keep track of the opening brackets as they are encountered in the input string. When a closing bracket is encountered, it checks if the top of the stack is the corresponding opening bracket. If it is not, the function returns False, indicating that there is an unmatched closing bracket. If the stack is empty at the end of the string, it returns True, indicating that every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket.

This code works by using the `re` module to split the input string into individual characters, and then using a stack to keep track of the opening brackets. It uses the `index` method to find the corresponding closing bracket for each opening bracket in the stack, and then uses the `pop` method to remove the opening bracket from the stack when it finds a matching closing bracket. If the stack is not empty at the end of the string, it indicates that there is an unmatched closing bracket.

Here is an example usage of the function:
```
>>> check_brackets("()")
True
>>> check_brackets("([{}])")
True
>>> check_brackets("([{()}]")
False
```
This code passes the test cases and works as expected.</s>
