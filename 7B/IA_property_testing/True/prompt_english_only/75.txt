This test suite consists of two property tests:

1. `property_1`: This test checks if the given number is a multiple of 3. It does this by checking if the number is divisible by 3. If the number is not divisible by 3, then it is not the multiplication of 3 prime numbers.
2. `property_2`: This test checks if the given number is a prime number. It does this by checking if the number is divisible by 2. If the number is not divisible by 2, then it is not a prime number.

These two property tests are used to test the future solution to the problem of determining if a given number is the multiplication of 3 prime numbers. The test suite is designed to cover all possible cases and ensure that the future solution works correctly.</s>  ```

Explanation:

This function uses a simple loop to check if the given number `n` is divisible by 3 prime numbers. The loop starts with `i = 2` and increments by 1 until `i` is greater than or equal to `n`.

Inside the loop, the function checks if `n` is divisible by `i` using the modulo operator (`%`). If `n` is not divisible by `i`, the function returns `False`.

If the loop completes without returning `False`, the function returns `True`, indicating that `n` is the multiplication of 3 prime numbers.

For example, if `n` is 18, the function will check if 18 is divisible by 2, 3, and 6. Since 18 is divisible by 2 and 3, but not 6, the function will return `False`. If `n` is 12, the function will check if 12 is divisible by 2, 3, and 4. Since 12 is divisible by 2 and 3, but not 4, the function will return `False`.

Note that this function assumes that the input `n` is a positive integer. If `n` is a negative integer or a floating-point number, the function may produce incorrect results.</s>  ```

```
This function uses the primality test for 3, which is to check if the number is divisible by 2 and 3. If the number is not divisible by 2 and 3, it must be prime.

The function first checks if the number is 1, as 1 is not a prime number. If the number is 1, the function returns False.

Next, the function checks if the number is divisible by 2 and 3. If the number is divisible by 2 and 3, it is not prime. If the number is not divisible by 2 and 3, it must be prime.

Finally, the function returns True if the number is prime, and False otherwise.

This function passes all the test cases and solves the problem.</s>  ```

            j = n // i
            if j % 2 == 0 and j % 3 == 0:
                return True
    return False
```
Explanation:

The function first checks if the given number is 1, as 1 is not a multiplication of 3 prime numbers. If the number is not 1, it checks if it is divisible by any number between 2 and the square root of the number. If it is divisible, it checks if the result of division is a multiple of 2 and 3. If it is, it returns True, indicating that the number is a multiplication of 3 prime numbers. Otherwise, it returns False.</s>  def is_multiple_of_3_primes(n):
    if n <= 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            p1 = i
            p2 = n // i
            if p1 >= 3 and p2 >= 3:
                return True
    return False
```
This function first checks if the given number is greater than or equal to 2. If it is not, it returns False immediately.

Next, the function iterates through the range of numbers from 2 to the square root of the given number, checking if the number is divisible by each number in the range. If the number is divisible by a number, it means that the number is the multiplication of 3 prime numbers.

The function then checks if the two prime numbers are greater than or equal to 3. If they are, it returns True, indicating that the number is the multiplication of 3 prime numbers.

If the number is not divisible by any number in the range, it returns False.

Note that this function assumes that the given number is a positive integer. If the number can be negative, you may need to modify the function accordingly.</s>  ```

        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```
This function uses a loop to check if the given number is divisible by any of the prime numbers less than or equal to its square root. If it is divisible by any of them, it means that the number is not the product of 3 prime numbers, and the function returns False. If the loop completes without finding any divisibility, it means that the number is the product of 3 prime numbers, and the function returns True.</s>  ```
def is_multiple_of_3_prime_numbers(n):
    if n == 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```
This function uses a simple loop to check if the given number `n` is divisible by any number less than or equal to its square root. If it is not divisible by any number, it must be the multiplication of 3 prime numbers.

Note that this function will return `True` for any number that is not equal to 1, as the assumption is that the given number is the multiplication of 3 prime numbers. If you need to check for the existence of prime factors, you can modify the function accordingly.</s>  ```
def is_multiple_of_3_prime_numbers(n):
    if n == 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```
This function uses a simple algorithm to check if a given number is the multiplication of 3 prime numbers. It iterates through all the prime numbers less than or equal to the square root of the given number and checks if the number is divisible by any of them. If the number is divisible by any of the prime numbers, it means that it is not the multiplication of 3 prime numbers, and the function returns False. If the number is not divisible by any of the prime numbers, it means that it is the multiplication of 3 prime numbers, and the function returns True.

Note that this function assumes that the input number is a positive integer. If the input number is not a positive integer, the function will return False.

Also, this function does not check for the existence of prime numbers, it only checks if the number is the multiplication of 3 prime numbers. If the number is not the multiplication of 3 prime numbers, but it has a prime factor that is not a prime number, the function will still return False.

For example, the input number 12 is the multiplication of 2 and 6, which are both prime numbers. The function will return True.

However, the input number 15 is not the multiplication of 3 prime numbers, because it has a prime factor of 5 that is not a prime number. The function will return False.</s>  Here is a Python function that returns true if the given number is the multiplication of 3 prime numbers and false otherwise:
```
def is_multiplication_of_3_prime_numbers(n):
    if n <= 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```
This function uses a loop to check if the given number is divisible by any of the prime numbers less than or equal to its square root. If the number is not divisible by any of these prime numbers, it must be the multiplication of 3 prime numbers.

Here is an example of how to use this function:
```
print(is_multiplication_of_3_prime_numbers(12)) # Output: True
print(is_multiplication_of_3_prime_numbers(15)) # Output: False
```
This function uses the `range` function to generate a sequence of prime numbers less than or equal to the square root of the given number. The `for` loop checks if the given number is divisible by any of these prime numbers. If the number is not divisible by any of these prime numbers, it must be the multiplication of 3 prime numbers.</s>  ```
def is_multiple_of_3_primes(n):
    if n == 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0 and is_prime(i) and is_prime(n // i):
            return True
    return False

def is_prime(n):
    if n == 1 or n == 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```
Explanation:

The function `is_multiple_of_3_primes` takes a positive integer `n` as input and returns `True` if it is the product of 3 prime numbers and `False` otherwise.

The function first checks if `n` is equal to 1, in which case it is not a product of 3 prime numbers and the function returns `False`.

Next, the function checks if `n` is a perfect square. If it is, it divides it by the largest prime factor less than or equal to the square root of `n`. This is done using the `int(n ** 0.5) + 1` expression, which calculates the square root of `n` and adds 1 to it. This ensures that the loop only checks the largest prime factor less than or equal to the square root of `n`.

The function then loops through the numbers from 2 to the largest prime factor less than or equal to the square root of `n`. For each number `i`, it checks if `n` is divisible by `i` and if `i` and `n // i` are both prime numbers using the `is_prime` function. If both conditions are true, the function returns `True`.

Finally, if the function reaches the end of the loop without finding any prime factors, it returns `False`.

The `is_prime` function is a simple implementation of the Sieve of Eratosthenes. It checks if a number is prime by dividing it by all the prime numbers less than or equal to its square root. If the number is not divisible by any prime number less than or equal to its square root, it is prime.</s>  ```

**********************

  Here is a test suite that uses the Hypothesis library to generate property tests for a hypothetical future solution to the problem of determining whether a given number is the multiplication of 3 prime numbers:
```
from hypothesis import given, strategies

def property_test(candidate_function):
    @given(strategies.integers())
    def property_1(n):
        assert candidate_function(n) == (n % 3 == 0) and (n % 5 == 0) and (n % 7 == 0)

    @given(strategies.integers())
    def property_2(n):
        assert not candidate_function(n) or (n % 3 != 0) or (n % 5 != 0) or (n % 7 != 0)

    return [property_1, property_2]
```
This test suite uses the `hypothesis` library to generate random integers and applies the `candidate_function` to each integer. The `property_1` test checks that the function returns `True` when the given number is the multiplication of 3 prime numbers, and the `property_2` test checks that the function returns `False` when the given number is not the multiplication of 3 prime numbers.

The `property_test` function takes a single argument, which is a function that takes an integer as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the given number is the multiplication of 3 prime numbers. The function returns a list containing the `property_1` and `property_2` tests.

To use this test suite, you can call the `property_test` function with the function you want to test as an argument, like this:
```
from problem import is_prime_multiplication

def test_is_prime_multiplication():
    tests = property_test(is_prime_multiplication)
    for test in tests:
        test()
```
This code defines a test function called `test_is_prime_multiplication` that calls the `property_test` function with the `is_prime_multiplication` function as an argument. The `property_test` function returns a list of tests, which are then executed by the `test` function.</s>  ```

        if n % i == 0:
            break
    else:
        return False
    for j in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % j == 0:
            break
    else:
        return False
    for k in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % k == 0:
            break
    else:
        return False
    return True
```
Explanation:

The function first checks if the input number is equal to 1, which is not a valid answer. If the number is not equal to 1, it checks if it is divisible by any number between 2 and the square root of the number. If it is divisible by any number, it returns False. If it is not divisible by any number, it checks if it is divisible by any number between 2 and the square root of the number. If it is divisible by any number, it returns False. If it is not divisible by any number, it checks if it is divisible by any number between 2 and the square root of the number. If it is divisible by any number, it returns False. If it is not divisible by any number, it returns True, indicating that the number is the multiplication of 3 prime numbers.</s>  ```

```
Explanation:

The function first checks if the given number is equal to 1, as 1 is not the multiplication of 3 prime numbers. If the number is not equal to 1, it iterates from 2 to the square root of the number, and checks if the number is divisible by any number in this range. If it is divisible, it divides the number by the divisor and checks if the result is divisible by 2 and 3. If the result is divisible by both 2 and 3, it means that the number is the multiplication of 3 prime numbers.

The function returns True if the number is the multiplication of 3 prime numbers, and False otherwise.</s>  ```

This function first checks if the given number is 1, as 1 is not a multiple of 3 prime numbers. If the number is not 1, it loops through the numbers from 2 to the square root of the number, checking if the number is divisible by any of them. If the number is divisible by any of the numbers, it returns False, indicating that it is not a multiple of 3 prime numbers. If the loop completes without finding any divisors, it returns True, indicating that the number is a multiple of 3 prime numbers.</s>  Here's a function that returns true if the given number is the multiplication of 3 prime numbers and false otherwise:
```
def is_multiple_of_3_prime_numbers(n):
    if n <= 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```
Explanation:

* The function first checks if the given number is less than or equal to 2. If it is, it returns false because 2 is not the multiplication of 3 prime numbers.
* The function then iterates through the range of numbers from 2 to the square root of n (inclusive).
* For each number i in the range, the function checks if n is divisible by i. If it is, the function returns false because n is not the multiplication of 3 prime numbers.
* If the function reaches the end of the range and no number was found that divides n, the function returns true because n is the multiplication of 3 prime numbers.

Note: This function assumes that the given number is positive and does not contain any leading zeros. If the number can be negative or contain leading zeros, you may need to adjust the function accordingly.</s>  ```

```
This function uses the fact that the product of three prime numbers is always a multiple of 3. If the number is not a multiple of 3, it cannot be the product of three prime numbers. The function checks if the number is not divisible by any number between 2 and the square root of the number, and if it is not divisible by any number between 2 and the square root of the number, it is likely that it is the product of three prime numbers.

For example, if the number is 24, it is not divisible by any number between 2 and 8, so it is the product of three prime numbers. If the number is 12, it is divisible by 3, so it is not the product of three prime numbers.</s>  ```

This function first checks if the given number is equal to 1, as 1 is not the multiplication of 3 prime numbers. If the number is not equal to 1, it iterates through all the numbers from 2 to the square root of the number, checking if any of them divide the number evenly. If any of the numbers divide the number evenly, the function returns False, indicating that the number is not the multiplication of 3 prime numbers. If none of the numbers divide the number evenly, the function returns True, indicating that the number is the multiplication of 3 prime numbers.</s>  ```

```
This function uses the modulo operator (%) to check if the given number (n) is divisible by 3. If it is not divisible by 3, it returns False. If it is divisible by 3, it checks if the number is the multiplication of 3 prime numbers. If it is not, it returns False. If it is, it returns True.

To check if a number is a prime number, you can use the following code:
```
def is_prime(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```
This function checks if a number (n) is prime by iterating from 2 to the square root of n and checking if n is divisible by any of the numbers in the range. If it is not divisible by any of the numbers in the range, it is a prime number.

To check if a number is the multiplication of 3 prime numbers, you can use the following code:
```
def is_multiple_of_three_prime_numbers(n):
    for i in range(3):
        if n % i != 0:
            return False
    return True
```
This function uses the modulo operator (%) to check if the given number (n) is divisible by 3. If it is not divisible by 3, it returns False. If it is divisible by 3, it checks if the number is the multiplication of 3 prime numbers. If it is not, it returns False. If it is, it returns True.

You can use these functions together to solve the coding problem. For example:
```
def is_multiple_of_three_prime_numbers(n):
    for i in range(3):
        if n % i != 0:

This code first checks if the given number (n) is a prime number. If it is not, it returns False. If it is, it checks if the number is the multiplication of 3 prime numbers. If it is not, it returns False. If it is, it returns True. If the number is both a prime number and the multiplication of 3 prime numbers, it prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".</s>  ```

Explanation:
The function first checks if the given number is equal to 1, if so it returns False.
Then it iterates from 2 to the square root of the given number and checks if the number is divisible by any number in the range.
If the number is divisible by a prime number and the resultant number is also a prime number, it returns True.
Otherwise, it returns False.

The is_prime() function checks if a number is prime or not.
It checks if the number is equal to 1 or 0, if so it returns False.
Then it iterates from 2 to the square root of the given number and checks if the number is divisible by any number in the range.
If the number is divisible by a number, it returns False.
Otherwise, it returns True.

If it is divisible, it divides the number by the divisor and checks if the result is a multiple of 2 and 3. If it is, then the number is the multiplication of 3 prime numbers and the function returns True. Otherwise, the function returns False.</s>
