-------------------
  Here is a test suite for the `fruit_distribution` function:
```

  "Test 1": {
    "in": {
      "s": "5 apples and 6 oranges",
      "n": 19
    },

}
```
In this test suite, each test case consists of a pair of inputs and an expected output. The inputs are the `s` and `n` parameters, which are passed to the `fruit_distribution` function. The expected output is the result of calling the function with those inputs. The test suite includes four test cases, each testing a different combination of inputs and expected outputs.</s>  ```
def fruit_distribution(s, n):
    apples, oranges = map(int, s.split(" and "))
    return n - apples - oranges
```
Explanation:

The function `map` is used to split the input string `s` into two parts, `apples` and `oranges`, using the `split` method. The `split` method takes a string as its argument and returns a list of substrings. In this case, the substrings are separated by the string `" and "`. The list is then converted to a tuple using the `map` function.

The function `int` is used to convert the two elements of the tuple to integers.

Finally, the function returns the difference between the input `n` and the sum of the `apples` and `oranges`.</s>  ```
def fruit_distribution(s, n):
    apples, oranges = map(int, s.split(' and '))
    return n - apples - oranges
```
Explanation:

The `map()` function is used to convert the string representation of the number of apples and oranges to integers. The `split()` method is then used to split the string at the `' and '` delimiter, which separates the number of apples from the number of oranges. The resulting list is then passed to the `map()` function to convert the values to integers.

The rest of the code simply subtracts the number of apples and oranges from the total number of fruits in the basket to determine the number of mango fruits in the basket.</s>  ```

The second test case has the input `s = "0 apples and 1 oranges"` and `n = 3`. The output is expected to be `2`, which is the number of mango fruits in the basket.

The third test case has the input `s = "2 apples and 3 oranges"` and `n = 100`. The output is expected to be `95`, which is the number of mango fruits in the basket.

The fourth test case has the input `s = "100 apples and 1 oranges"` and `n = 120`. The output is expected to be `19`, which is the number of mango fruits in the basket.</s>  ```
def fruit_distribution(s, n):
    apples, oranges = [int(i) for i in s.split(' and ')]
    return n - apples - oranges
```
This code uses list comprehension to split the input string into a list of integers, where the first element is the number of apples and the second element is the number of oranges. The code then subtracts the number of apples and oranges from the total number of fruits in the basket to get the number of mango fruits in the basket.</s>  Here is a Python code that solves the problem:
```
def fruit_distribution(s, n):
    apples, oranges = map(int, s.split('and'))
    return n - apples - oranges
```
This code uses the `map()` function to split the string into two parts, using the `'and'` separator. The first part is the number of apples, and the second part is the number of oranges. The `int()` function is used to convert the strings to integers. The function then subtracts the number of apples and oranges from the total number of fruits in the basket, which gives the number of mango fruits.

For example, if the input string is `"5 apples and 6 oranges"` and the total number of fruits is 19, the output would be 19 - 5 - 6 = 8, which is the number of mango fruits in the basket.

Note that this code assumes that the input string is in the format `"<number> apples and <number> oranges"`. If the input string is in a different format, the code may not work correctly.</s>  Here is the code sample:
```
def fruit_distribution(s, n):
    apples, oranges = map(int, s.split(" and "))
    return n - apples - oranges
```
This code uses the `map` function to split the string `s` into two parts, the number of apples and the number of oranges. It then subtracts the number of apples and oranges from the total number of fruits in the basket, which is represented by the integer `n`. The result is the number of mango fruits in the basket.

Note that the code assumes that the string `s` will always be in the format "number apples and number oranges". If the string is not in this format, the code may not produce the correct result.</s>  ```
def fruit_distribution(s, n):
    apples = int(s.split(" and ")[0])
    oranges = int(s.split(" and ")[1].split(" ")[0])
    return n - apples - oranges
```
This code uses the `split()` method to split the input string into two parts, where the first part represents the number of apples and the second part represents the number of oranges.

  Here is a JSON test suite for the `fruit_distribution` function:
```
{
  "test_1": {
    "in": {
      "s": "5 apples and 6 oranges",
      "n": 19
    },
    "out": 8

      "s": "100 apples and 1 oranges",
      "n": 120
    },
    "out": 19
  }
}
```
The test suite includes four test cases, each with a pair of inputs (the string and the integer) and an expected output. The `in` field contains the input parameters for the function, and the `out` field contains the expected output. The test names are not necessary, but they can be useful for debugging purposes.</s>  ```
def fruit_distribution(s, n):
    apples, oranges = [int(i) for i in s.split()]
    return n - apples - oranges
```
This code first splits the input string into a list of two elements using the `split()` method, where each element is a string representing the number of apples and oranges, respectively. Then, the list is unpacked into two variables `apples` and `oranges` using the `[int(i) for i in s.split()]` comprehension, where `i` is each element in the list. Finally, the function returns the number of mango fruits in the basket by subtracting the number of apples and oranges from the total number of fruits in the basket.</s>  ```
def fruit_distribution(s, n):
    apples, oranges = map(int, s.split(' and '))
    return n - apples - oranges
```
This code uses the `split()` method to split the input string into two parts, separated by the word "and". The `map()` function is then used to convert the two parts to integers. Finally, the `n` variable is subtracted from the total number of apples and oranges to get the number of mango fruits in the basket.</s>  def fruit_distribution(s, n):
    apple_count, orange_count = map(int, s.split())

def fruit_distribution(s, n):
    apples, oranges = map(int, s.split(' and '))
    return n - apples - oranges
```</s>  Here is a possible implementation of the `fruit_distribution` function:
```
def fruit_distribution(s, n):
    apples, oranges = s.split(' and ')
    apples, oranges = int(apples), int(oranges)
    mango = n - apples - oranges
    return mango
```
This implementation first splits the input string into two parts using the `split` method, with the `and` keyword as the delimiter. It then converts each part to an integer using the `int` function. Finally, it returns the difference between the total number of fruits in the basket (which is the input `n`) and the number of apples and oranges.

Note that this implementation assumes that the input string is in the correct format, i.e. that there is an integer number of apples and oranges, and that the total number of fruits in the basket is greater than the number of apples and oranges. If this is not the case, the implementation may produce incorrect results or throw an error.</s>  ```

In this case, we are using `map` to split the string `s` into two parts, `apples` and `oranges`, using the `split` method.

  }
}
```
This test suite contains four tests, each with a unique name and inputs and expected outputs. The `in` object contains the `s` and `n` parameters that will be passed to the `fruit_distribution` function, and the `out` object contains the expected output of the function.</s>  ```
def fruit_distribution(s, n):
    apples, oranges = [int(i) for i in s.split()]
    return n - apples - oranges
```
Explanation:

The function first splits the input string `s` into two substrings using the space character as the delimiter. The resulting list contains two elements, the first representing the number of apples and the second representing the number of oranges.

The function then uses list comprehension to convert the two substrings into integers.

Finally, the function returns the result of subtracting the number of apples and oranges from the total number of fruits in the basket.</s>  ```
def fruit_distribution(s, n):
    apples = int(s.split(' ')[0])
    oranges = int(s.split(' ')[2])
    return n - apples - oranges
```
This code uses the `split()` method to split the input string into a list of tokens, where each token is a word. We then use the `int()` function to convert the first and third tokens (which represent the number of apples and oranges) to integers. Finally, we subtract the number of apples and oranges from the total number of fruits in the basket (which is given by the `n` parameter) to get the number of mango fruits in the basket.</s>  Here is the code for the function you described:
```
def fruit_distribution(s, n):
    apples, oranges = map(int, s.split('and'))
    return n - apples - oranges
```
This code first uses the `map` function to split the string into two parts, `apples` and `oranges`, using the `and` keyword as the delimiter. It then converts these strings to integers using the `int` function. Finally, it returns the difference between the total number of fruits in the basket (`n`) and the number of apples and oranges.

Note that this code assumes that the input string will always be in the format "X apples and Y oranges", where X and Y are integers. If the input string is not in this format, the code may produce unexpected results.</s>  ```
def fruit_distribution(s, n):
    apples, oranges = map(int, s.split("and"))
    return n - apples - oranges
```
Explanation:

The `map()` function is used to convert the string representation of the number of apples and oranges into a list of integers. The `int()` function is then used to convert each item in the list into an integer. The `split()` function is used to split the string into two parts, separated by the word "and". The resulting list is then passed as arguments to the `map()` function, which applies the `int()` function to each item in the list. The result is a list of integers representing the number of apples and oranges.

The rest of the code simply subtracts the number of apples and oranges from the total number of fruits in the basket to find the number of mango fruits.</s>  def fruit_distribution(s, n):

```
def fruit_distribution(s, n):
    apples, oranges = map(int, s.split())
    return n - apples - oranges
```
This code first splits the input string into two parts using the `split()` method, which creates a list of two strings. The first element of this list is the number of apples, and the second element is the number of oranges. The `map()` function is then used to convert these strings to integers, and the resulting list is unpacked into two variables, `apples` and `oranges`.

The function then returns the difference between the total number of fruits in the basket (i.e., `n`) and the number of apples and oranges. This value is the number of mango fruits in the basket.

Note that this code assumes that the input string is in the format "number of apples and number of oranges". If the input string is in a different format, this code may not work as expected.</s>  ```
def fruit_distribution(s, n):
    apples, oranges = [int(i) for i in s.split(' and ')]
    return n - apples - oranges
```
Explanation:

The function first splits the input string into two parts using the `' and '` delimiter. The resulting list will contain two elements, the first representing the number of apples and the second representing the number of oranges.

We then convert both elements to integers using list comprehension.

Finally, we subtract the number of apples from the total number of fruits in the basket and the number of oranges to get the number of mango fruits in the basket.

Note that if the input string contains more than two parts, this function will raise a `ValueError`.</s>  ```

import ast
def fruit_distribution(s, n):

```
def fruit_distribution(s, n):
    apples, oranges = map(int, s.split("and"))
    return n - apples - oranges
```
This code uses the `map` function to split the input string into two parts, separated by the word "and". It then converts the two parts to integers using the `int` function. The final line of the code returns the result of subtracting the number of apples and oranges from the total number of fruits in the basket.</s>

```
This test suite includes four tests, each with a different input string and integer value for the total number of fruits in the basket. The output for each test is the expected number of mango fruits in the basket.</s>  Here is a solution to the problem:
```
def fruit_distribution(s, n):
    apples, oranges = map(int, s.split(' and '))
    return n - apples - oranges
```
This solution uses the `map` function to split the input string into two parts, the number of apples and the number of oranges. It then subtracts the number of apples and oranges from the total number of fruits in the basket to get the number of mango fruits.</s>  ```
def fruit_distribution(s, n):

    orange_count = int(s.split(" ")[2])
    mango_count = n - apple_count - orange_count
    return mango_count
```
This code uses the `split()` method to split the input string into a list of substrings, and then uses the `int()` function to convert the substrings into integers. The `apple_count` variable is set to the number of apples in the basket, the `orange_count` variable is set to the number of oranges in the basket, and the `mango_count` variable is set to the total number of fruits in the basket minus the number of apples and oranges. The `return` statement returns the number of mango fruits in the basket.</s>  ```

    apple_count = s.count("apples")
    orange_count = s.count("oranges")
    mango_count = n - apple_count - orange_count
    return mango_count
```
This code uses the `count` method of the `str` class to count the number of occurrences of the words "apples" and "oranges" in the input string. It then calculates the number of mango fruits in the basket by subtracting the number of apples and oranges from the total number of fruits in the basket.</s>  ```

This code uses the `split()` method to split the input string into a list of words, where each word is a fruit and its quantity. The `int()` function is used to convert the string representations of the fruit counts into integers. The `return` statement then calculates the number of mango fruits in the basket by subtracting the total number of apples and oranges from the total number of fruits in the basket.</s>  Here is a Python code sample that solves the problem you described:

    orange_count = int(orange_count.split(' ')[0])
    mango_count = n - apple_count - orange_count
    return mango_count
```
This code uses the `split()` method to split the input string into two parts, one representing the number of apples and the other representing the number of oranges. It then uses the `int()` function to convert these strings to integers and performs the calculation to determine the number of mango fruits in the basket.

Note that this code assumes that the input string will always be in the format "X apples and Y oranges", where X and Y are integers representing the number of apples and oranges, respectively. If this assumption is not valid, the code may produce incorrect results.</s>  ```

def fruit_distribution(s, n):
    apples, oranges = map(int, s.split(' and '))

This code uses the `map()` function to split the input string into two integers, `apples` and `oranges`, and then subtracts them from the total number of fruits in the basket, `n`, to obtain the number of mango fruits.</s>  Here is a possible implementation of the `fruit_distribution` function using Python:
```

This function first splits the input string `s` into two parts using the `split()` method, where the first part represents the number of apples and the second part represents the number of oranges. It then converts these two parts into integers using the `int()` function. Finally, it returns the number of mango fruits in the basket, which is calculated by subtracting the number of apples and oranges from the total number of fruits in the basket.

For example, if the input string is `"5 apples and 6 oranges"` and the total number of fruits is `19`, the function will return `8`, as there are `8` mango fruits in the basket. If the input string is `"0 apples and 1 oranges"` and the total number of fruits is `3`, the function will return `2`, as there are `2` mango fruits in the basket.</s>  ```
