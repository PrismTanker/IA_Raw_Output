Prompt: 
    Given a positive integer n, return the count of the numbers of n-digit
    positive integers that start or end with 1.
    
-------------------
  Here is a test suite for the future solution to the given problem:

```
from hypothesis import given, strategies

def property_test(candidate_function):

    @given(strategies.integers(min_value=1, max_value=10))
    def property_1(n):
        count = candidate_function(n)
        assert count == n * 10

    @given(strategies.integers(min_value=1000000000, max_value=9999999999))
    def property_2(n):
        count = candidate_function(n)
        assert count == n * 10

    @given(strategies.integers(min_value=1, max_value=10))
    def property_3(n):
        count = candidate_function(n)
        assert count == 0

    @given(strategies.integers(min_value=1000000000, max_value=9999999999))
    def property_4(n):
        count = candidate_function(n)
        assert count == 0

    return [property_1, property_2, property_3, property_4]
```

The `property_test` function takes a candidate function as an argument, and returns a list of property tests. Each property test is a function that takes an integer `n` as input and verifies that the candidate function returns the correct count of n-digit positive integers that start or end with 1.

The first two property tests, `property_1` and `property_2`, test the case where `n` is a small integer between 1 and 10, and verify that the candidate function returns the correct count of n-digit positive integers that start or end with 1. The third and fourth property tests, `property_3` and `property_4`, test the case where `n` is a large integer between 1000000000 and 9999999999, and verify that the candidate function returns the correct count of n-digit positive integers that start or end with 1.

The `given` decorator is used to specify the input for each property test. The `strategies` module is used to generate random integers for the input.

The test suite is designed to cover a wide range of scenarios, including edge cases, and to ensure that the candidate function works correctly for all possible inputs.</s>  To solve this problem, we can use a combination of string manipulation and list comprehension.
```
def count_ones(n):
    ones = [str(i) for i in range(10**n)]
    return sum(1 for i in ones if i.startswith('1') or i.endswith('1'))
```
This code creates a list of all possible n-digit positive integers using list comprehension, and then uses the `startswith()` and `endswith()` methods to check if each integer starts or ends with the digit 1. The `sum()` function is then used to count the number of integers that meet the condition.

Note that this code assumes that the input `n` is a positive integer. If the input can be any type of data, we would need to add a check to ensure that `n` is a positive integer before using it in the code.</s>  Here is a Python code that solves the problem:
```
def count_1s(n):
    count = 0
    for i in range(10**(n-1), 10**n):
        if str(i)[0] == '1' or str(i)[-1] == '1':
            count += 1
    return count
```
This code uses a simple for loop to iterate over the range of numbers from 10^(n-1) to 10^n. For each number, it checks if the first or last digit is equal to 1. If it is, the count is incremented. The final result is returned at the end.

Note that this code assumes that n is a positive integer. If n can be negative or zero, you will need to add an additional check to ensure that n is a positive integer before running the loop.</s>  ```
def count_ones_digit_numbers(n):
    count = 0
    for i in range(10**(n-1), 10**n):
        if str(i)[0] == "1" or str(i)[-1] == "1":
            count += 1
    return count
```</s>  ```
def count_ones(n):
    count = 0
    for i in range(10**(n-1), 10**n):
        if str(i)[0] == "1" or str(i)[-1] == "1":
            count += 1
    return count
```
This code uses a for loop to iterate over the range of n-digit positive integers, and checks if the number starts or ends with 1. If it does, the count is incremented. The return value is the final count of such numbers.</s>  ```
def count_1s(n):
    count = 0
    for i in range(10**(n-1), 10**n):
        if str(i)[0] == "1" or str(i)[-1] == "1":
            count += 1
    return count
```</s>  ```
def count_ones_starting_or_ending(n):
    count = 0
    for i in range(10**(n-1), 10**n):
        if str(i)[0] == "1" or str(i)[-1] == "1":
            count += 1
    return count
```</s>  ```
def count_ones(n):
    count = 0
    for i in range(10**(n-1), 10**n):
        if str(i)[0] == "1" or str(i)[-1] == "1":
            count += 1
    return count
```
This code uses a for loop to iterate through the range of 10**(n-1) to 10**n, and checks if the current number starts or ends with 1. If it does, it increments the count. The return statement at the end returns the count.</s>  ```
def count_ones(n):
    count = 0
    for i in range(10**(n-1), 10**n):
        if str(i)[0] == "1" or str(i)[-1] == "1":
            count += 1
    return count
```
This code uses a loop to iterate over the range of positive integers from 10^(n-1) to 10^n. For each integer, it checks if the first or last digit is 1, and if so, it increments the count. The return statement at the end returns the count.

Note that this code assumes that n is a positive integer. If n is a negative integer or a string, it will throw an error. Also, this code does not handle the case where n is 1, as the range of integers from 10^0 to 10^1 does not contain any numbers that start or end with 1.</s>  ```

    count = 0
    for i in range(10**(n-1), 10**n):
        if str(i)[0] == '1' or str(i)[-1] == '1':
            count += 1
    return count
