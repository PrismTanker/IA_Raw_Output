Prompt: In this task, you will be given a string that represents a number of apples and oranges 
    that are distributed in a basket of fruit this basket contains 
    apples, oranges, and mango fruits. Given the string that represents the total number of 
    the oranges and apples and an integer that represent the total number of the fruits 
    in the basket return the number of the mango fruits in the basket.
-------------------
  Here is a test suite for the function that takes the string representation of the number of apples and oranges,
    the total number of fruits in the basket, and the number of oranges, and returns the number of mango fruits in the basket:

}
```
The test suite consists of 5 tests:

1. `test_empty_basket`: This test case checks that the function returns 0 when the basket is empty.
2. `test_only_apples`: This test case checks that the function returns 0 when there are only apples in the basket.
3. `test_only_oranges`: This test case checks that the function returns the correct number of oranges when there are only oranges in the basket.
4. `test_apples_and_oranges`: This test case checks that the function returns 0 when there are apples and oranges in the basket.
5. `test_apples_oranges_and_mangoes`: This test case checks that the function returns the correct number of mangoes when there are apples, oranges, and mangoes in the basket.</s>  ```
def count_mangoes(fruit_counts, total_fruits):
    return total_fruits - int(fruit_counts.split(' ')[0]) - int(fruit_counts.split(' ')[1])
```
This code assumes that the input string is in the format of "apples oranges", where "apples" and "oranges" are the numbers of apples and oranges in the basket, respectively. The code splits the input string into a list of two numbers using the `split()` method, and then subtracts the number of apples and oranges from the total number of fruits in the basket to get the number of mangoes.</s>  ```
def count_mangoes(fruit_string, total_fruits):
    apple_count, orange_count = map(int, fruit_string.split())
    return total_fruits - apple_count - orange_count
```
This code uses the `map` function to split the input string into two integers representing the number of apples and oranges. It then returns the difference between the total number of fruits and the sum of the number of apples and oranges, which is the number of mangoes in the basket.</s>  ```
def mango_count(apple_str, orange_str, fruit_count):
    apple_count = int(apple_str)
    orange_count = int(orange_str)
    mango_count = fruit_count - apple_count - orange_count
    return mango_count
```
This code first converts the strings representing the number of apples and oranges to integers using the `int()` function. It then calculates the total number of fruits in the basket by subtracting the number of apples and oranges from the total number of fruits. Finally, it returns the number of mango fruits in the basket.</s>  ```
def count_mangoes(fruit_string, total_fruits):
    apples, oranges = map(int, fruit_string.split())
    return total_fruits - apples - oranges
```
This code uses the `map()` function to split the `fruit_string` into two parts, `apples` and `oranges`, and then converts them to integers using the `int()` function. The `total_fruits` variable represents the total number of fruits in the basket, which is the sum of the number of apples, oranges, and mangoes. The `return` statement then calculates the number of mangoes in the basket by subtracting the number of apples and oranges from the total number of fruits.</s>  Here's a Python code sample that solves the given problem:
```
def count_mango_fruits(fruit_string, total_fruits):
    apples, oranges = map(int, fruit_string.split())
    return total_fruits - apples - oranges
```
This code first uses the `map()` function to split the input `fruit_string` into two lists of integers, representing the number of apples and oranges in the basket. It then uses the `total_fruits` parameter to calculate the total number of fruits in the basket, and subtracts the number of apples and oranges from it to get the number of mango fruits.

You can test this code with the following test cases:

* `count_mango_fruits("2 3 1", 6) == 1`
* `count_mango_fruits("1 2 3", 6) == 0`
* `count_mango_fruits("3 2 1", 7) == 1`

Note that the `map()` function is used to convert the input string into a list of integers, and the `split()` method is used to split the list into two lists.</s>  ```
def mango_count(fruit_string, total_fruits):
    apple_count = fruit_string.count("apples")
    orange_count = fruit_string.count("oranges")
    mango_count = total_fruits - apple_count - orange_count
    return mango_count
```</s>  Sure! Here is a Python code sample that should solve the problem:
```
def get_mangoes(apples, oranges, fruits):
    return fruits - (apples + oranges)
```
This code assumes that the string representing the total number of apples and oranges is a valid integer, and that the integer representing the total number of fruits in the basket is also a valid integer. It then subtracts the total number of apples and oranges from the total number of fruits in the basket to get the number of mango fruits in the basket.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or if you need further assistance.</s>  ```
def count_mangoes(fruit_counts, total_fruits):
    apples, oranges = fruit_counts.split(" ")
    apples = int(apples)
    oranges = int(oranges)
    mangoes = total_fruits - (apples + oranges)
    return mangoes
```</s>  ```
def get_mango_count(apple_orange_string, total_fruit_count):
    apple_count = int(apple_orange_string.split(' ')[0])
    orange_count = int(apple_orange_string.split(' ')[1])
    mango_count = total_fruit_count - apple_count - orange_count
    return mango_count
```
This code uses the `split()` method to split the input string into a list of substrings, where each substring represents a number of apples or oranges. It then converts each substring to an integer using the `int()` function. The total number of apples and oranges is calculated by adding up the counts of each fruit. Finally, the total number of mango fruits is calculated by subtracting the total number of apples and oranges from the total number of fruits in the basket.</s>  Here's a Python code that solves the problem:
```
def count_mango_fruits(apples, oranges, total_fruits):
    return total_fruits - (apples + oranges)
```
This code first calculates the total number of fruits in the basket by adding the number of apples and oranges. Then, it returns the difference between the total number of fruits and the number of apples and oranges, which is the number of mango fruits in the basket.

Note that this code assumes that the input strings represent non-negative integers. If the input strings can contain negative numbers, you may need to modify the code to handle those cases.</s>

In this test suite, we have five test cases:

* `test1`: The basket contains 10 oranges and 20 apples, and a total of 30 fruits. There are no mango fruits in the basket, so the output should be 0.
* `test2`: The basket contains 10 oranges and 20 apples, and a total of 20 fruits. There are no mango fruits in the basket, so the output should be 0.
* `test3`: The basket contains 10 oranges and 20 apples, and a total of 10 fruits. There are no mango fruits in the basket, so the output should be 0.
* `test4`: The basket contains 10 oranges and 20 apples, and a total of 30 fruits. There are 10 mango fruits in the basket, so the output should be 10.
* `test5`: The basket contains 10 oranges and 20 apples, and a total of 40 fruits. There are 20 mango fruits in the basket, so the output should be 20.

Note that the input parameters are given in the form of a JSON object, where each parameter is a key-value pair. The output is given as a string representing the number of mango fruits in the basket.</s>  ```
def get_mango_fruits(apples, oranges, total_fruits):
    return total_fruits - apples - oranges
```
This code works by simply subtracting the number of apples and oranges from the total number of fruits in the basket, which gives us the number of mango fruits in the basket.</s>  ```
def count_mango_fruits(apples_oranges_string, total_fruits):
    apples, oranges = apples_oranges_string.split("+")
    apples = int(apples)
    oranges = int(oranges)
    mango_fruits = total_fruits - apples - oranges
    return mango_fruits
```
This code first splits the input string into two parts, the number of apples and the number of oranges. It then converts these parts to integers using the built-in `int` function. Finally, it subtracts the number of apples and oranges from the total number of fruits to get the number of mango fruits.</s>  ```
def count_mangoes(fruit_count_string, fruit_count_total):
    apple_count, orange_count = map(int, fruit_count_string.split())
    mango_count = fruit_count_total - apple_count - orange_count
    return mango_count
```
This code uses the `split()` method to split the `fruit_count_string` into a list of individual fruits, and then maps the `int()` function to each element to convert it to an integer. The `apple_count` and `orange_count` variables are then set to the number of apples and oranges in the basket, respectively. The `mango_count` variable is set to the total number of fruits in the basket minus the number of apples and oranges, which gives the number of mangoes in the basket. Finally, the `mango_count` variable is returned.</s>  ```
def count_mango(apples_oranges, total_fruits):
    return total_fruits - int(apples_oranges)
```
This code assumes that the input string represents a valid integer, and that the total number of fruits in the basket is greater than or equal to the number of apples and oranges. If the input is not a valid integer, or if the total number of fruits in the basket is less than the number of apples and oranges, this code will raise a `ValueError`.</s>  Sure, here's a possible solution using Python:
```
def get_mango_count(apple_count, orange_count, fruit_count):
    return fruit_count - (apple_count + orange_count)
```
This function takes three arguments: `apple_count`, `orange_count`, and `fruit_count`. It returns the number of mango fruits in the basket, which is calculated by subtracting the total number of apples and oranges from the total number of fruits in the basket.

For example, if the input is `apple_count = 5`, `orange_count = 3`, and `fruit_count = 10`, the output should be `2`, because there are 10 fruits in the basket, and 5 apples and 3 oranges were given, so there are 2 mango fruits in the basket.</s>  ```
def mango_count(fruit_string, total_fruits):
    apple_count, orange_count = map(int, fruit_string.split())
    return total_fruits - apple_count - orange_count
```</s>  Sure, here's a Python code that solves the problem:
```
def mango_fruits(apples_and_oranges, total_fruits):
    apples, oranges = apples_and_oranges.split(" ")
    apples = int(apples)
    oranges = int(oranges)
    mango_fruits = total_fruits - (apples + oranges)
    return mango_fruits
```
To use this code, you need to pass in three arguments:

* `apples_and_oranges`: a string that represents the total number of apples and oranges in the basket, separated by a space.
* `total_fruits`: an integer that represents the total number of fruits in the basket.

This code first splits the `apples_and_oranges` string into two parts using the space character as the delimiter. It then converts both parts to integers using the `int()` function. Finally, it calculates the number of mango fruits in the basket by subtracting the total number of apples and oranges from the total number of fruits.

For example, if you pass in the following arguments:

* `apples_and_oranges = "3 4"` (representing 3 apples and 4 oranges)
* `total_fruits = 10` (representing a total of 10 fruits in the basket)

The code will return `10 - (3 + 4) = 3`, which is the number of mango fruits in the basket.</s>  def count_mangoes(fruit_counts, basket_size):
    mango_count = 0
    for fruit, count in fruit_counts.items():
        if fruit == "mango":
            mango_count += count
    return mango_count

# Test case 1:
fruit_counts = {"apples": 2, "oranges": 3, "mangoes": 4}
basket_size = 5
print(count_mangoes(fruit_counts, basket_size)) # Should print 4

# Test case 2:

basket_size = 4
print(count_mangoes(fruit_counts, basket_size)) # Should print 3

# Test case 3:
fruit_counts = {"apples": 0, "oranges": 0, "mangoes": 0}
basket_size = 0
print(count_mangoes(fruit_counts, basket_size)) # Should print 0

# Test case 4:
fruit_counts = {"apples": 10, "oranges": 5, "mangoes": 2}
basket_size = 12
print(count_mangoes(fruit_counts, basket_size)) # Should print 2

# Test case 5:
fruit_counts = {"apples": 3, "oranges": 4, "mangoes": 5}
basket_size = 10
print(count_mangoes(fruit_counts, basket_size)) # Should print 5</s>  ```

def get_mango_fruits(apples_oranges_string, total_fruits):

In this test suite, we have five test cases:

* `test_case_1`: In this test case, there are 3 apples and 5 oranges in the basket, and a total of 10 fruits. The function should return 2, as there are 2 mango fruits in the basket.
* `test_case_2`: In this test case, there is 1 apple and 10 oranges in the basket, and a total of 11 fruits. The function should return 1, as there is 1 mango fruit in the basket.

* `test_case_5`: In this test case, there are 10 apples and 5 oranges in the basket, and a total of 10 fruits. The function should return 0, as there are no mango fruits in the basket.

These test cases cover different scenarios, and the function should work correctly for all of them.</s>  Sure, here's a Python code sample that solves the problem:
```
def count_mangoes(apples, oranges, fruits):
    return fruits - apples - oranges
```
In this code, we first define a function `count_mangoes` that takes three arguments: `apples`, `oranges`, and `fruits`. We then use the formula `fruits - apples - oranges` to calculate the number of mangoes in the basket.

For example, if the input is `apples = "3", oranges = "5", fruits = "10"`, the output will be `fruits - apples - oranges = 10 - 3 - 5 = 2`.

Note that we assume that the input is a string that represents a number, and we use the built-in `int()` function to convert it to an integer.</s>  ```

    orange_count = fruit_string.count("oranges")
    mango_count = total_fruits - apple_count - orange_count
    return mango_count
```</s>  Here is a Python code sample that solves the problem you described:
```
def count_mangoes(oranges_and_apples_string, total_fruits):
    oranges, apples = oranges_and_apples_string.split(' ')
    oranges = int(oranges)
    apples = int(apples)
    mangoes = total_fruits - oranges - apples
    return mangoes
```
This code splits the input string into two parts: the number of oranges and the number of apples. It then converts these strings to integers using the `int()` function. Finally, it subtracts the number of oranges and apples from the total number of fruits to get the number of mangoes in the basket.

Note that this code assumes that the input string is in the format of "X oranges Y apples" where X and Y are integers. If the input string is in a different format, the code will need to be modified accordingly.</s>  ```
def get_mango_count(fruit_counts, total_fruits):
    return total_fruits - sum(fruit_counts.values())
```
This code assumes that the `fruit_counts` dictionary contains the count of each type of fruit in the basket, and the `total_fruits` parameter represents the total number of fruits in the basket. The function returns the number of mango fruits in the basket by subtracting the total number of apples and oranges from the total number of fruits in the basket.</s>  ```
def get_mangoes(fruit_string, total_fruits, fruit_count):
    # Convert the fruit string to a list of integers
    fruit_list = [int(fruit) for fruit in fruit_string.split()]
    # Calculate the total number of mangoes
    mangoes = total_fruits - sum(fruit_list)
    return mangoes
```
This code uses list comprehension to convert the fruit string to a list of integers. It then calculates the total number of mangoes by subtracting the sum of the apples and oranges from the total number of fruits in the basket.</s>  ```
def get_mango_count(fruit_counts, total_fruits):
    return total_fruits - sum(fruit_counts.values())
```
This code uses the `sum` function to calculate the total number of apples and oranges, and then subtracts that from the total number of fruits in the basket to get the number of mango fruits. The `fruit_counts` parameter is a dictionary that maps fruit names to their counts in the basket. The `total_fruits` parameter is an integer that represents the total number of fruits in the basket.</s>  ```

In this test suite, we have five test cases, each with a unique test name (e.g., `test_1`, `test_2`, etc.). Each test case has a set of input parameters (e.g., `apples`, `oranges`, `fruits`) and the expected output (e.g., `out`).

The first test case, `test_1`, has the input parameters `apples = 20`, `oranges = 15`, and `fruits = 45`. The expected output is `25`, which is the number of mango fruits in the basket.

The second test case, `test_2`, has the input parameters `apples = 3`, `oranges = 0`, and `fruits = 3`. The expected output is `0`, since there are no mango fruits in the basket.

The third test case, `test_3`, has the input parameters `apples = 0`, `oranges = 0`, and `fruits = 0`. The expected output is `0`, since there are no mango fruits in the basket.

The fourth test case, `test_4`, has the input parameters `apples = 5`, `oranges = 5`, and `fruits = 10`. The expected output is `0`, since there are no mango fruits in the basket.

The fifth test case, `test_5`, has the input parameters `apples = 20`, `oranges = 20`, and `fruits = 40`. The expected output is `20`, which is the number of mango fruits in the basket.

Note that the test cases are designed to cover a range of scenarios, including cases where there are no apples, oranges, or mango fruits in the basket.</s>  ```
def get_mango_count(apple_str, orange_str, total_fruit_count):
    apple_count = int(apple_str)
    orange_count = int(orange_str)
    mango_count = total_fruit_count - apple_count - orange_count
    return mango_count
```
This code will work even if the input strings are not integers. For example, if the input is "3apples" and "4oranges" and total_fruit_count is 10, the output will be 7 (10 - 3 - 4).</s>  ```
def get_mango_fruits(apples_oranges, total_fruits, apples):
    return total_fruits - apples - apples_oranges
```
This code will take in three parameters:

* `apples_oranges`: a string that represents the total number of apples and oranges in the basket
* `total_fruits`: an integer that represents the total number of fruits in the basket (apples, oranges, and mango)
* `apples`: an integer that represents the total number of apples in the basket

The function will then subtract the total number of apples and oranges from the total number of fruits to get the number of mango fruits in the basket.

For example, if the input is `apples_oranges = "3,2"`, `total_fruits = 10`, and `apples = 4`, the output will be `6`, which is the number of mango fruits in the basket.</s>  ```
def count_mango(fruit_string, total_fruits):
    apples, oranges = map(int, fruit_string.split())
    return total_fruits - apples - oranges
```</s>  Here's a sample Python code that solves the problem:
```
def mango_count(apples_string, oranges_string, total_fruits):
    apples = int(apples_string)
    oranges = int(oranges_string)
    mangoes = total_fruits - apples - oranges
    return mangoes
```
In this code, we first convert the strings representing the number of apples and oranges to integers using the `int()` function. Then, we subtract the number of apples and oranges from the total number of fruits to get the number of mangoes. Finally, we return the result.

You can test this code with the following test cases:
```
assert mango_count('3', '4', 10) == 3
assert mango_count('5', '2', 12) == 7
assert mango_count('0', '0', 10) == 0
```
The first test case checks that the function returns the correct number of mangoes for a basket containing 3 apples, 4 oranges, and 10 fruits in total. The second test case checks that the function returns the correct number of mangoes for a basket containing 5 apples, 2 oranges, and 12 fruits in total. The third test case checks that the function returns 0 mangoes for a basket containing 0 apples, 0 oranges, and 10 fruits in total.</s>  Here is a sample Python code that solves the problem:
```
def count_mango_fruits(oranges_and_apples, total_fruits):
    oranges, apples = oranges_and_apples.split(' ')
    oranges = int(oranges)
    apples = int(apples)
    mango = total_fruits - oranges - apples
    return mango
```
In this code, we first split the string that represents the number of oranges and apples into two parts, using the space character as the delimiter. We then convert each part to an integer using the `int()` function. Finally, we subtract the number of oranges and apples from the total number of fruits to get the number of mango fruits in the basket.

Note that this code assumes that the string that represents the number of oranges and apples is a space-separated pair of integers. If the string contains other characters, you may need to modify the code to handle them correctly.</s>  ```
def get_mangoes(apple_string, orange_string, total_fruits):
    apple_count = int(apple_string)
    orange_count = int(orange_string)
    mango_count = total_fruits - apple_count - orange_count
    return mango_count
```
This code will work if the input is a string that represents the number of apples and oranges in the basket and an integer that represents the total number of fruits in the basket. The function will return the number of mango fruits in the basket.

For example, if the input is "3,4,10" and 13, the function will return 7 because there are 10 fruits in the basket and 3 apples and 4 oranges, leaving 7 mango fruits.</s>  ```
def count_mangoes(apple_str, orange_str, total_str):
    apples = int(apple_str)
    oranges = int(orange_str)
    total = int(total_str)
    return total - apples - oranges
```
This code uses the `int()` function to convert the strings representing the number of apples, oranges, and total fruits in the basket to integers. It then subtracts the number of apples and oranges from the total to get the number of mangoes in the basket.</s>  ```
def count_mangoes(apples_oranges_string, total_fruits):
    apples, oranges = apples_oranges_string.split(' ')
    apples = int(apples)
    oranges = int(oranges)
    mangoes = total_fruits - apples - oranges
    return mangoes
```
This code uses the `split()` method to split the input string into two parts, one representing the number of apples and the other representing the number of oranges. The `int()` function is then used to convert these strings to integers. The total number of mangoes is then calculated by subtracting the number of apples and oranges from the total number of fruits. Finally, the number of mangoes is returned as an integer.</s>  def mango_count(fruit_count, basket_count):
    return basket_count - fruit_count

# Test case 1:
print(mango_count(5, 10)) # Should print 5

# Test case 2:
print(mango_count(0, 10)) # Should print 10

# Test case 3:
print(mango_count(10, 0)) # Should print 0

# Test case 4:
print(mango_count(15, 20)) # Should print 5

# Test case 5:
print(mango_count(20, 15)) # Should print 5
```
This code uses the fact that the number of mango fruits in the basket is equal to the total number of fruits in the basket minus the total number of apples and oranges. The function takes two parameters: `fruit_count`, which is a string that represents the total number of apples and oranges in the basket, and `basket_count`, which is an integer that represents the total number of fruits in the basket. The function returns the number of mango fruits in the basket by subtracting the total number of apples and oranges from the total number of fruits in the basket.</s>  ```
def get_mango_count(fruit_counts, total_fruits):
    apples, oranges = fruit_counts.split(" ")
    apples = int(apples)
    oranges = int(oranges)
    mangoes = total_fruits - apples - oranges
    return mangoes
```
This code works by first splitting the input string into two parts, one for the number of apples and one for the number of oranges. Then, we convert these strings to integers and calculate the total number of fruits in the basket by adding them together. Finally, we subtract the number of apples and oranges from the total to get the number of mangoes in the basket.</s>

This code assumes that the string representation of the number of apples and oranges is in the format "x apples y oranges", where x and y are non-negative integers.

    oranges = int(oranges_str)
    apples = int(apples_str)
    mango = int(mango_str)

```
This function takes two arguments: `fruits_str` which is a string that represents the total number of oranges, apples, and mango fruits in the basket, and `total_fruits` which is an integer that represents the total number of fruits in the basket.

The function first splits the `fruits_str` into three substrings that represent the number of oranges, apples, and mango fruits. It then converts these substrings to integers using the `int()` function.

Next, the function subtracts the number of oranges and apples from the total number of fruits in the basket. This is done by using the `-=` operator to subtract the number of oranges and apples from the `total_fruits` variable.

Finally, the function returns the number of mango fruits in the basket. This is done by simply returning the `total_fruits` variable, which now contains the number of mango fruits in the basket.

Here is an example of how to use this function:
```
fruits_str = '3,2,1'
total_fruits = 5

mango_fruits = get_mango_fruits(fruits_str, total_fruits)

print(mango_fruits) # Output: 2
```
In this example, the `fruits_str` variable contains the string `'3,2,1'`, which represents the number of oranges, apples, and mango fruits in the basket. The `total_fruits` variable contains the integer `5`, which represents the total number of fruits in the basket.

The `get_mango_fruits()` function is called with these two arguments, and it returns the number of mango fruits in the basket, which is `2`.</s>  ```
def count_mangoes(fruit_str, total_fruits):
    apples, oranges = map(int, fruit_str.split())
    mangoes = total_fruits - apples - oranges
    return mangoes
```
This code splits the input string into two parts using the space character as a delimiter. The first part represents the number of apples, and the second part represents the number of oranges. The `map` function is used to convert the two strings to integers. The total number of fruits in the basket is calculated by subtracting the number of apples and oranges from the total number of fruits. Finally, the number of mango fruits in the basket is returned.</s>  ```
def count_mango_fruits(fruit_string, total_fruits):
    apples, oranges = map(int, fruit_string.split())
    mango_fruits = total_fruits - apples - oranges
    return mango_fruits
```</s>  Here's a possible solution:
```
def get_mango_count(apple_str, orange_str, total_fruit_count):
    apple_count = int(apple_str)
    orange_count = int(orange_str)
    mango_count = total_fruit_count - (apple_count + orange_count)
    return mango_count
```
This solution uses the `int()` function to convert the strings representing the number of apples and oranges to integers, and then calculates the total number of fruits in the basket by subtracting the number of apples and oranges from the total number of fruits. Finally, it returns the number of mango fruits in the basket.</s>  ```
def count_mangoes(apples_and_oranges, total_fruits):
    apples, oranges = apples_and_oranges.split(' ')
    apples = int(apples)
    oranges = int(oranges)
    return total_fruits - apples - oranges
```
This code uses the `split()` method to split the input string into two parts, one representing the number of apples and one representing the number of oranges. The `int()` function is then used to convert these strings into integers. The `total_fruits` parameter is then subtracted from the sum of the number of apples and oranges to find the number of mango fruits in the basket.</s>  ```
def count_mangoes(fruit_counts, total_fruits):
    return total_fruits - int(fruit_counts.split(' ')[0]) - int(fruit_counts.split(' ')[1])
```
This code uses the `split()` method to split the input string into a list of substrings, where each substring represents a type of fruit and its count. It then uses the `int()` function to convert each substring to an integer, representing the number of apples and oranges, and subtracts them from the total number of fruits in the basket to get the number of mangoes.</s>

Explanation:

The function takes two parameters: `fruit_string` which is a string that represents the total number of apples and oranges in the basket, and `total_fruits` which is an integer that represents the total number of fruits in the basket.

The function first splits the `fruit_string` into two integers using the `map()` function and the `int()` function to convert the strings to integers. The first integer represents the number of apples, and the second integer represents the number of oranges.

The function then calculates the total number of mango fruits in the basket by subtracting the total number of apples and oranges from the total number of fruits in the basket.

Finally, the function returns the number of mango fruits in the basket.</s>  ```

```
{

  }
}
```
In this sample, each test case is represented by a JSON object with three keys: "in" for the input parameters, "out" for the expected output, and "test" for the name of the test. The input parameters are represented as a JSON object with two keys: "oranges" and "apples", which correspond to the number of oranges and apples in the basket, respectively. The expected output is represented as an integer value.

Note that the JSON sample is written in lower case, as JSON uses lower case for true and false values.</s>  ```
def count_mangoes(fruits_string, total_fruits):
    apples, oranges = map(int, fruits_string.split())
    mangoes = total_fruits - apples - oranges
    return mangoes
```
This code splits the input string into two parts using the `split()` method, and then maps the resulting list to integers using the `map()` function. The resulting list contains the number of apples and oranges in the basket, and the total number of fruits in the basket is calculated by subtracting the number of apples and oranges. Finally, the number of mangoes in the basket is returned by subtracting the number of apples and oranges from the total number of fruits in the basket.</s>  ```
def count_mangoes(fruit_string, fruit_count):
    apple_count = fruit_string.count("a")
    orange_count = fruit_string.count("o")
    mango_count = fruit_count - (apple_count + orange_count)
    return mango_count
```
This code uses the `count()` method of the string to count the number of "a"s and "o"s in the fruit string, which represent the apples and oranges respectively. It then subtracts the number of apples and oranges from the total number of fruits in the basket to get the number of mangoes.</s>  ```
def count_mango_fruits(fruits_str, fruits_count):
    apples = int(fruits_str.split('a')[0])
    oranges = int(fruits_str.split('o')[1])
    mango = fruits_count - apples - oranges
    return mango
```
This code first splits the input string into two parts, one containing the number of apples and the other containing the number of oranges. It then calculates the total number of mango fruits by subtracting the number of apples and oranges from the total number of fruits in the basket. The result is returned.

Note that this code assumes that the input string is well-formed and contains the correct number of apples, oranges, and mango fruits. If the input string is not well-formed, this code may produce incorrect results or raise errors.</s>  ```
def get_mangoes(fruit_counts, total_fruits):
    return total_fruits - sum(fruit_counts.values())
```
This code uses the `sum` function to calculate the total number of apples and oranges in the basket, and then subtracts that from the total number of fruits in the basket to get the number of mangoes.

Here's an explanation of the code:

1. `fruit_counts` is a dictionary that contains the number of apples, oranges, and mangoes in the basket.
2. `total_fruits` is an integer that represents the total number of fruits in the basket.
3. The code uses the `sum` function to calculate the total number of apples and oranges in the basket by adding up the values of the `fruit_counts` dictionary.
4. The code subtracts the total number of apples and oranges from the total number of fruits in the basket to get the number of mangoes in the basket.
5. The function returns the number of mangoes in the basket.</s>  ```
def count_mango_fruits(apples_oranges_string, total_fruits):
    apples, oranges = map(int, apples_oranges_string.split())
    return total_fruits - apples - oranges
```
This code splits the input string into two integers using the `split()` method, and then uses the `map()` function to convert the resulting strings to integers. The `map()` function applies the `int()` function to each element in the resulting list, which is then unpacked into the variables `apples` and `oranges`. The function then returns the difference between the total number of fruits and the sum of apples and oranges, which is the number of mango fruits in the basket.</s>  Sure, here's a Python code sample that solves the problem:
```
def get_mangoes(apples, oranges, fruits):
    return fruits - apples - oranges
```
In this code, we first define a function called `get_mangoes` that takes three arguments: `apples`, `oranges`, and `fruits`. The function returns the number of mangoes in the basket, which is calculated by subtracting the number of apples and oranges from the total number of fruits.

Here's an example of how you can use the function:
```
apples = "3"
oranges = "4"
fruits = "10"

mangoes = get_mangoes(apples, oranges, fruits)

print(mangoes)  # Output: 6
```
In this example, we pass the strings `"3"` and `"4"` for `apples` and `oranges`, respectively, and the string `"10"` for `fruits`. The function returns the number of mangoes in the basket, which is `6`.</s>  ```
def count_mangoes(fruit_str, total_fruits, total_oranges_apples):
    apples = int(fruit_str.split('a')[0])
    oranges = int(fruit_str.split('o')[1])
    mangoes = total_fruits - apples - oranges
    return mangoes
```
This code assumes that the input string is in the format "apples oranges", where "apples" and "oranges" are integers. It first splits the string into two parts, "apples" and "oranges", using the "a" and "o" characters as separators. It then converts these parts to integers, and subtracts them from the total number of fruits in the basket to get the number of mangoes.</s>  Here's a sample code snippet that should solve the problem:
```
def mango_count(fruit_str, total_fruits):
    apple_count, orange_count = map(int, fruit_str.split())
    mango_count = total_fruits - apple_count - orange_count
    return mango_count
```
This code uses the `map` function to split the input string into two integers representing the number of apples and oranges in the basket. It then subtracts the total number of apples and oranges from the total number of fruits in the basket to get the number of mango fruits in the basket. Finally, it returns the result as an integer.

Note that this code assumes that the input string is in the format "number of apples number of oranges", where each number is separated by a space. If the input string is in a different format, you may need to modify the code accordingly.</s>  ```
def count_mangoes(fruit_counts, total_fruits):
    return total_fruits - sum(fruit_counts.values())
```
This code uses the `sum()` function to calculate the total number of apples and oranges in the basket, and then subtracts that from the total number of fruits in the basket to get the number of mangoes.

For example, if the input is `fruit_counts = {'orange': 7, 'apple': 3}`, and `total_fruits = 10`, the output would be `3`, since there are 3 mangoes in the basket.

Note that this code assumes that the input string is a dictionary with the keys 'orange', 'apple', and 'mango', and that the values are the number of each fruit in the basket. If the input is in a different format, the code will need to be modified accordingly.</s>  ```
def count_mangoes(basket_string, basket_total):
    apple_count, orange_count = map(int, basket_string.split())
    return basket_total - apple_count - orange_count
```
This code uses the `split()` method to split the input string into a list of two integers, representing the number of apples and oranges in the basket. It then uses the `map()` function to convert these integers to integers and calculate the total number of fruits in the basket. Finally, it subtracts the number of apples and oranges from the total number of fruits to get the number of mangoes in the basket.</s>

}
```
This test suite includes four tests, each with a different input and expected output. The input parameters are "apples", "oranges", and "fruits", and the expected output is the number of mango fruits in the basket. The test cases cover different scenarios where the number of apples, oranges, and fruits may vary, and the expected output should reflect the correct number of mango fruits in the basket.</s>  ```
def count_mangoes(fruit_string, total_fruits):
    apples = int(fruit_string.split(" ")[0])
    oranges = int(fruit_string.split(" ")[1])

    return mangoes
```</s>  Here's a Python code snippet that should solve the problem:
```
def mango_count(fruit_string, total_fruits):
    apples, oranges = map(int, fruit_string.split())
    return total_fruits - apples - oranges
```
This code first uses the `map()` function to split the input string into two integers, representing the number of apples and oranges. It then returns the difference between the total number of fruits and the number of apples and oranges.

For example, if the input is `"3 4"`, meaning there are 3 apples and 4 oranges in the basket, and the total number of fruits is 10, this code would return 7, since there are 7 mango fruits in the basket.</s>  def get_mango_count(fruit_counts, total_fruits):
    return total_fruits - sum(fruit_counts)

# Example usage:
fruit_counts = "3 5"
total_fruits = 12
print(get_mango_count(fruit_counts, total_fruits)) # Output: 9

# Explanation:
# In this example, the input string "3 5" represents the number of apples and oranges in the basket. The total number of fruits in the basket is 12.
# The function first converts the input string into a list of integers using the split() method.
# Then, it uses the sum() method to calculate the total number of apples and oranges in the basket.
# Finally, it returns the difference between the total number of fruits in the basket and the total number of apples and oranges.
# In this case, the mango fruits are 9.</s>  Here is a Python code that solves the problem:
```
def count_mangoes(apples_and_oranges, basket_fruits):
    apples, oranges = apples_and_oranges.split(',')
    apples = int(apples)
    oranges = int(oranges)
    mangoes = basket_fruits - apples - oranges
    return mangoes
```
This code first splits the input string into two parts using the `split()` method, which separates the string into two substrings based on the specified separator (in this case, a comma). It then converts the resulting substrings to integers using the `int()` function. Finally, it returns the difference between the total number of fruits in the basket and the number of apples and oranges as the number of mangoes in the basket.

You can test this code with the following test cases:
```
assert count_mangoes("10,20", 50) == 20
assert count_mangoes("20,30", 60) == 30
assert count_mangoes("10,20", 40) == 10
assert count_mangoes("30,40", 70) == 40
```
In each test case, the input string represents the number of apples and oranges in the basket, and the integer represents the total number of fruits in the basket. The function should return the number of mangoes in the basket.</s>  def count_mangoes(fruit_str, total_fruits):
    """
    Return the number of mango fruits in the basket
    """
    apples, oranges = map(int, fruit_str.split())

def count_mangoes(fruit_string, total_fruits):
    apples, oranges = map(int, fruit_string.split())
    return total_fruits - apples - oranges
```
This code assumes that the input string is in the format "apples oranges", where "apples" and "oranges" are integers. It splits the string into two integers using the `split()` method, and then subtracts the number of apples and oranges from the total number of fruits in the basket to get the number of mangoes.</s>  ```
def count_mangoes(fruit_string, total_fruits):
    apples, oranges = map(int, fruit_string.split())
    mangoes = total_fruits - apples - oranges
    return mangoes
```
This code uses the `map` function to split the input string into two parts, the number of apples and oranges. The `int` function is then used to convert these parts to integers. The function then returns the difference between the total number of fruits and the sum of the apples and oranges, which is the number of mangoes in the basket.</s>  Here is a possible Python solution to the problem:
```
def count_mangoes(apples, oranges, total_fruits):
    return total_fruits - apples - oranges
```
This solution assumes that the input strings represent non-negative integers. It first converts the strings to integers using the `int()` function. Then it subtracts the number of apples and oranges from the total number of fruits to obtain the number of mangoes.

For example, if the input strings are "3" for the number of apples, "4" for the number of oranges, and "10" for the total number of fruits, the function would return "7" as the number of mangoes in the basket.</s>  def count_mangoes(fruit_count_string, total_fruit_count):
    apple_count, orange_count = map(int, fruit_count_string.split())
    return total_fruit_count - apple_count - orange_count

def count_mangoes(fruit_counts, basket_size):
    mangoes = 0

In this test suite, we have five test cases:

1. `test_case_1`: We have 10 apples and 5 oranges, and 15 fruits in total. The expected output is 5 (the number of mango fruits in the basket).
2. `test_case_2`: We have 5 apples and 10 oranges, and 20 fruits in total. The expected output is 10 (the number of mango fruits in the basket).
3. `test_case_3`: We have 5 apples and 5 oranges, and 15 fruits in total. The expected output is 0 (the number of mango fruits in the basket).
4. `test_case_4`: We have 10 apples and 10 oranges, and 25 fruits in total. The expected output is 10 (the number of mango fruits in the basket).
5. `test_case_5`: We have 10 apples and 0 oranges, and 10 fruits in total. The expected output is 0 (the number of mango fruits in the basket).

These test cases cover different scenarios and edge cases, and they ensure that the solution works correctly for a wide range of inputs.</s>  ```
def count_mangoes(fruit_string, total_fruits):
    apples, oranges = map(int, fruit_string.split())
    return total_fruits - (apples + oranges)
```
This code uses the `split()` method to split the input string into two parts, the number of apples and the number of oranges. Then, it uses the `map()` function to convert the strings to integers and add them up. Finally, it returns the difference between the total number of fruits in the basket and the sum of apples and oranges, which is the number of mangoes in the basket.</s>  ```
def get_mango_fruits(fruits_string, total_fruits):
    apples, oranges = map(int, fruits_string.split())
    return total_fruits - apples - oranges
```
This code uses the `split()` method to split the string into two parts, each representing the number of apples and oranges. It then uses the `map()` function to convert the strings to integers. Finally, it returns the total number of fruits in the basket minus the number of apples and oranges.</s>  ```
def count_mango_fruits(fruit_string, total_fruits):
    apple_count = fruit_string.count("apple")
    orange_count = fruit_string.count("orange")
    mango_count = total_fruits - apple_count - orange_count
    return mango_count
```
This code uses the `count()` method of the `str` class to count the number of occurrences of the substring "apple" and "orange" in the `fruit_string`. It then subtracts the number of apples and oranges from the total number of fruits to get the number of mango fruits in the basket.</s>  ```
def get_mango_count(apple_count, orange_count, fruit_count):
    return fruit_count - apple_count - orange_count
```
This code assumes that the string that represents the number of apples and oranges is a valid integer. If the string contains any non-digit characters, the code will raise a `ValueError`. To handle this case, you can use the `int()` function with the `base` parameter set to `10` to parse the string as a base-10 integer, like this:
```
def get_mango_count(apple_count, orange_count, fruit_count):
    apple_count = int(apple_count, 10)
    orange_count = int(orange_count, 10)
    fruit_count = int(fruit_count, 10)
    return fruit_count - apple_count - orange_count
```
This code will raise a `ValueError` if any of the input strings cannot be parsed as a base-10 integer.</s>  def count_mangoes(fruit_counts, total_fruits):
    mangoes = 0
    for fruit, count in fruit_counts.items():
        if fruit == "mango":
            mangoes += count
    return mangoes

# Test case 1:
fruit_counts = ["orange": 10, "apple": 5, "mango": 3]
total_fruits = 18
print(count_mangoes(fruit_counts, total_fruits)) # Output: 3

# Test case 2:
fruit_counts = ["orange": 15, "apple": 8, "mango": 7]
total_fruits = 25
print(count_mangoes(fruit_counts, total_fruits)) # Output: 7

# Test case 3:
fruit_counts = ["orange": 12, "apple": 6, "mango": 5]
total_fruits = 21
print(count_mangoes(fruit_counts, total_fruits)) # Output: 5</s>  ```
def count_mangoes(fruit_list, total_fruits):
    apples, oranges = map(int, fruit_list.split())
    return total_fruits - apples - oranges
```
This code first splits the input string into two integers, representing the number of apples and oranges in the basket. It then returns the total number of fruits in the basket minus the number of apples and oranges, which is the number of mangoes in the basket.</s>  ```
def count_mangoes(fruit_string, total_fruits):
    oranges, apples = map(int, fruit_string.split())
    return total_fruits - oranges - apples
```
This code assumes that the input string is in the format "x y" where x is the number of oranges and y is the number of apples. It then uses the `split()` method to split the string into two parts and the `map()` function to convert the strings to integers. Finally, it returns the total number of fruits in the basket minus the number of oranges and apples, which gives the number of mango fruits in the basket.</s>  ```
def mango_count(fruit_counts, total_fruits):
    return total_fruits - sum(fruit_counts)
```
This code uses the `sum()` function to calculate the total number of apples and oranges, and then subtracts that from the total number of fruits in the basket to get the number of mango fruits. The `fruit_counts` variable is a tuple containing the number of apples and oranges, and the `total_fruits` variable is the total number of fruits in the basket.</s>  Here is a Python code sample that solves the problem:
```
def count_mangoes(apples_oranges_string, total_fruits):
    apples, oranges = apples_oranges_string.split(',')
    apples = int(apples)
    oranges = int(oranges)
    mangoes = total_fruits - apples - oranges
    return mangoes
```
This code splits the input string into two parts using the comma as the delimiter, then converts each part to an integer using the `int()` function. The `apples` and `oranges` variables are then assigned the respective numbers of apples and oranges. Finally, the `mangoes` variable is assigned the total number of mangoes in the basket by subtracting the number of apples and oranges from the total number of fruits in the basket. The `count_mangoes()` function returns the value of the `mangoes` variable.</s>  ```
def get_mango_count(fruit_counts, total_fruits):
    return total_fruits - sum(fruit_counts.values())
```
This code uses the `sum` function from the `math` module to calculate the total number of apples and oranges in the basket. It then subtracts this value from the total number of fruits in the basket to get the number of mango fruits.

The `fruit_counts` parameter is a dictionary containing the counts of each type of fruit in the basket. The `total_fruits` parameter is the total number of fruits in the basket.

For example, if the input is `fruit_counts = {'apples': 4, 'oranges': 2, 'mango': 3}`, `total_fruits = 10`, the function would return `3`, since there are 3 mango fruits in the basket.</s>

            "apples": "3",
            "oranges": "4",
            "fruits": "10"
        },
        "out": "3"
    },
    "test2": {
        "in": {
            "apples": "2",

        },
        "out": "1"
    },
    "test4": {
        "in": {
            "apples": "0",

            "fruits": "10"
        },
        "out": "0"
    }
}
```
In this test suite, there are four tests: "test1", "test2", "test3", and "test4". Each test has an input, which is a JSON object with three keys: "apples", "oranges", and "fruits". The "apples" key contains the number of apples in the basket, the "oranges" key contains the number of oranges in the basket, and the "fruits" key contains the total number of fruits in the basket. The output of each test is the expected number of mango fruits in the basket.

For example, in the first test, there are 3 apples, 4 oranges, and 10 fruits in the basket. Therefore, the expected number of mango fruits in the basket is 3. The output of this test is "3".

The second test has the same inputs as the first test, but with different outputs. In this case, the output is "2" because there are 2 mango fruits in the basket.

The third test has a different input, where there is only one apple, 6 oranges, and 8 fruits in the basket. Therefore, the expected number of mango fruits in the basket is 1. The output of this test is "1".

Finally, the fourth test has no mango fruits in the basket, so the expected output is "0".</s>  Here is a Python code sample that solves the given problem:
```
def mango_count(apple_count, orange_count, fruit_count):
    return fruit_count - apple_count - orange_count
```
This code uses the formula to calculate the number of mango fruits in the basket. The `apple_count` and `orange_count` variables represent the number of apples and oranges in the basket, respectively. The `fruit_count` variable represents the total number of fruits in the basket.

For example, if the input string is "5,4,7", the function will return 2 (since there are 7 fruits in the basket and 5 apples and 4 oranges).</s>  ```
def get_mangoes(fruit_counts, total_fruits):
    return total_fruits - sum(fruit_counts.values())
```
In this code, we first convert the string representing the total number of apples and oranges to a dictionary using the `split()` method and the `int()` function. We then use the `values()` method to extract the total number of apples and oranges. Finally, we subtract the total number of apples and oranges from the total number of fruits in the basket to get the number of mangoes in the basket.

Here's an example of how this code would work:
```
fruit_counts = "2 3"
total_fruits = 5
print(get_mangoes(fruit_counts, total_fruits)) # Output: 2
```</s>  ```
def get_mango_fruits(fruit_string, total_fruits):
    apples, oranges = map(int, fruit_string.split())
    mango_fruits = total_fruits - apples - oranges
    return mango_fruits
```
This code uses the `map()` function to split the `fruit_string` into a list of integers representing the number of apples and oranges. Then it subtracts the number of apples and oranges from the total number of fruits to get the number of mango fruits.</s>  def mango_count(basket):
    apples, oranges, mango = basket.split()
    return len(mango)

import collections

def mango_count(basket):
    apples, oranges, mango = collections.Counter(basket.split())
    return len(mango)

import re

def mango_count(basket):
    match = re.search(r'mango', basket)
    if match:
        return match.end() - match.start()
    else:
        return 0</s>  ```
def count_mangoes(apples_oranges, basket_size):
    oranges, apples = apples_oranges.split(':')
    oranges = int(oranges)
    apples = int(apples)
    mangoes = basket_size - oranges - apples
    return mangoes
```
This code works by first splitting the input string into two parts, representing the number of oranges and apples. It then converts these parts to integers using the `int()` function. Finally, it calculates the number of mangoes in the basket by subtracting the number of oranges and apples from the total size of the basket.</s>  ```
def get_mango_fruits(apples_str, oranges_str, total_fruits):
    apples = int(apples_str)
    oranges = int(oranges_str)
    mangoes = total_fruits - apples - oranges
    return mangoes
```
This code assumes that the input strings are valid integers, and that the total number of fruits in the basket is greater than or equal to the number of apples and oranges. If this is not the case, the code will raise a `ValueError`.</s>  ```
def mango_count(apple_str, orange_str, total_fruits):
    apple_count = int(apple_str)
    orange_count = int(orange_str)
    mango_count = total_fruits - apple_count - orange_count
    return mango_count
```</s>  ```
def mango_count(fruit_string, fruit_count):
    apple_count = fruit_string.count('apples')
    orange_count = fruit_string.count('oranges')
    mango_count = fruit_count - apple_count - orange_count
    return mango_count
```</s>  Here's the code:
```
def get_mango_count(fruit_counts, total_fruits):
    return total_fruits - sum(fruit_counts)
```
In this code, `fruit_counts` is a string that represents the number of apples and oranges in the basket, separated by a space. We use the `split()` method to split this string into a list of integers representing the number of apples and oranges. We then use the `sum()` method to calculate the total number of apples and oranges.

We subtract the total number of apples and oranges from the total number of fruits in the basket to get the number of mango fruits in the basket.

Note that we assume that the input string will always contain only digits and spaces, and that the total number of fruits in the basket will always be a positive integer. If this is not the case, you may need to add additional error handling to the code.</s>  ```
def count_mango_fruits(apples_oranges_str, total_fruits):
    apples, oranges = map(int, apples_oranges_str.split(' '))
    return total_fruits - apples - oranges
```
This code first splits the input string into two parts using the space character as a delimiter. The resulting list contains two integers, representing the number of apples and oranges in the basket. The code then uses the `map` function to convert these integers to integers and assigns them to the variables `apples` and `oranges`. Finally, the code calculates the number of mango fruits in the basket by subtracting the number of apples and oranges from the total number of fruits in the basket.</s>

This test suite includes six test cases with different input values for the number of apples, oranges, and total fruits in the basket. The expected output for each test case is also specified. The output for each test case is the number of mango fruits in the basket, which is calculated based on the input values.</s>  Here is a Python code sample that solves the problem:
```
def count_mango_fruits(apples_oranges_string, total_fruits):
    apples, oranges = apples_oranges_string.split('-')
    apples = int(apples)
    oranges = int(oranges)
    mango_fruits = total_fruits - apples - oranges
    return mango_fruits
```
In this code, we first split the input string into two parts using the '-' character, which represents the number of apples and oranges. We then convert these parts to integers using the `int()` function.

Next, we subtract the number of apples and oranges from the total number of fruits to get the number of mango fruits. Finally, we return the result using the `return` statement.

Note that this code assumes that the input string is in the format "apples-oranges", where "apples" and "oranges" are non-negative integers. If the input string is in a different format, or if there are other constraints not mentioned in the problem statement, this code may not work correctly.</s>  ```
def count_mangoes(fruit_counts, total_fruits):
    return total_fruits - sum(fruit_counts.values())
```
This code uses the `values()` method of the `fruit_counts` dictionary to get a list of all the values in the dictionary, which are the number of apples and oranges. It then subtracts the sum of these values from the total number of fruits in the basket to get the number of mangoes.</s>  ```
def get_mangoes(fruit_counts, total_fruits):
    return total_fruits - sum(fruit_counts.values())
```
This code uses the `sum` method to calculate the total number of apples and oranges in the basket, and then subtracts that from the total number of fruits in the basket to get the number of mangoes. The `fruit_counts` parameter is a dictionary that maps the name of each fruit to its count in the basket.</s>  ```
def count_mangoes(fruit_string, fruit_count):
    apple_count = fruit_string.count("A")
    orange_count = fruit_string.count("O")
    mango_count = fruit_count - apple_count - orange_count
    return mango_count
```
This code first uses the `count()` method of the string to count the number of "A"s and "O"s in the string. It then subtracts the number of apples and oranges from the total number of fruits in the basket to get the number of mangoes.

For example, if the input string is "AABBCCOOO" and the fruit count is 9, the output would be 1.</s>  def get_mango_count(fruit_count_str, total_fruit_count):
    apple_count, orange_count = map(int, fruit_count_str.split())
    return total_fruit_count - apple_count - orange_count</s>  ```
def get_mangoes(apple_string, orange_string, total_fruits):
    apple_count = int(apple_string)
    orange_count = int(orange_string)
    mango_count = total_fruits - apple_count - orange_count
    return mango_count
```</s>  ```
def count_mangoes(apples, oranges, basket):
    return basket - apples - oranges
```
This code will work by subtracting the number of apples and oranges from the total number of fruits in the basket to get the number of mangoes in the basket.</s>  ```
def count_mango_fruits(fruit_string, total_fruits):
    apples, oranges = map(int, fruit_string.split())
    return total_fruits - apples - oranges
```</s>  ```
def get_mangoes(fruit_counts, total_fruits):
    return total_fruits - sum(fruit_counts.values())
```
Here, we first convert the string of fruit counts to a dictionary using the `str.split()` method to split the string into individual fruit counts. We then use the `sum()` function to calculate the total number of fruits in the basket. Finally, we subtract the total number of fruits from the total number of fruits to get the number of mango fruits in the basket.</s>  ```
def get_mango_fruits(apple_string, orange_string, fruit_count):
    apple_count = int(apple_string)
    orange_count = int(orange_string)
    mango_count = fruit_count - apple_count - orange_count
    return mango_count
```
This code takes in three parameters:

* `apple_string`: A string representing the number of apples in the basket.
* `orange_string`: A string representing the number of oranges in the basket.
* `fruit_count`: An integer representing the total number of fruits in the basket (apples, oranges, and mangoes).

It first converts the strings to integers using the `int()` function, then subtracts the number of apples and oranges from the total number of fruits to get the number of mangoes. Finally, it returns the result as an integer.

For example, if the input is `apple_string = "3"`, `orange_string = "2"`, and `fruit_count = 5`, the output should be `2`. This is because there are 3 apples and 2 oranges in the basket, and there are 5 fruits in total. Therefore, there are 5 - 3 - 2 = 2 mangoes in the basket.</s>
