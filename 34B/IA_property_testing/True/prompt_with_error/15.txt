-------------------
  ```
from hypothesis import given, strategies

def property_test(candidate_function) -> None:
    @given(strategies.integers(min_value=0, max_value=100))
    def property_1(n):
        result = candidate_function(n)
        assert result.count(' ') == n - 1
        assert all(x.isdigit() for x in result.split(' '))

    @given(strategies.integers(min_value=0, max_value=100))
    def property_2(n):
        result = candidate_function(n)
        assert result.startswith('0')
        assert result.endswith(' '.join(map(str, range(1, n))))

    return [property_1, property_2]
```
This test suite checks two properties of the function:

1. The function should return a string containing space-delimited numbers starting from 0 upto n exclusive.
2. The function should return a string that starts with '0' and ends with the numbers from 1 to n-1 separated by spaces.

The test suite uses the `hypothesis` library to generate random inputs for the function and checks that the function satisfies the properties for all possible inputs.</s>  ```
def get_numbers(n):
    return " ".join(str(i) for i in range(n))
```
This code uses the `range` function to generate a sequence of numbers from 0 to `n-1`, and then joins them together in a string using the `join` method of strings. The `str` function is used to convert each number to a string before joining them together.

Here's an example of how you can use this function:
```
print(get_numbers(5)) # Output: "0 1 2 3 4"
```</s>  ```
def get_numbers_upto_n(n):
    return " ".join(str(i) for i in range(n))
```
Explanation:

The `range` function generates a sequence of numbers from 0 to `n-1`. The `join` method is used to join the elements of the sequence with a space character.

Here's an example usage:
```
print(get_numbers_upto_n(5)) # Output: "0 1 2 3 4"
```</s>  ```
def get_numbers(n):
    return " ".join(str(i) for i in range(n))
```</s>  ```
def get_numbers(n):
    return " ".join(str(i) for i in range(n))
```
This function uses the `range` function to generate a sequence of numbers from 0 to `n-1`, and then joins them into a string using the `join` method. The `str` function is used to convert each number to a string.

For example, `get_numbers(5)` would return the string `"0 1 2 3 4"`.</s>  ```
def get_numbers(n):
    return " ".join(str(i) for i in range(n))
```
Example:
```
>>> get_numbers(5)
'0 1 2 3 4'
```</s>  ```
def numbers_to_string(n):
    return " ".join(str(i) for i in range(n))
```
Explanation:

The `range` function generates a sequence of numbers from 0 to `n-1`. The `str.join` method is used to join the elements of this sequence into a string, separated by spaces.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```
print(numbers_to_string(5))  # Output: "0 1 2 3 4"
```</s>  ```
def get_numbers(n):
    return " ".join(str(i) for i in range(n))
```
Example:
```
print(get_numbers(5)) # Output: "0 1 2 3 4"
```</s>  ```
def get_numbers(n):
    return " ".join(str(i) for i in range(n))
```</s>  ```
def get_numbers(n):
    return " ".join(str(i) for i in range(n))
```
Example:
```
>>> get_numbers(5)
'0 1 2 3 4'
```</s>  ```
def get_numbers(n):
    return " ".join(str(i) for i in range(n))
```
Explanation:

The `range` function generates a sequence of numbers from 0 to `n-1`. The `str.join` method is used to join the elements of this sequence into a single string, separated by spaces.

Example usage:
```
>>> get_numbers(5)
'0 1 2 3 4'
```</s>

```
This test suite contains two property tests:

1. `property_1` tests that the output of the function is a string containing space-delimited numbers starting from 0 upto `n` exclusive. It does this by generating an integer `n` and then calling the `candidate_function` with `n` as an argument. The output of the function is then split on spaces and the resulting list is compared to a list of strings containing the numbers from 0 to `n-1`.
2. `property_2` tests that the output of the function only contains digits. It does this by generating an integer `n` and then calling the `candidate_function` with `n` as an argument. The output of the function is then split on spaces and the resulting list is checked to make sure that all of its elements are digits.

Note that these tests do not test the edge cases of the function, such as what happens when `n` is 0 or a negative number. To fully test the function, additional tests should be written to cover these cases.</s>  ```
def get_numbers(n):
    return " ".join(str(i) for i in range(n))
```</s>  ```
def get_numbers(n):
    return " ".join(str(i) for i in range(n))
```
Explanation:

The `range` function returns a sequence of numbers from 0 to `n-1`. The `str.join` method is used to join the elements of the sequence into a string, separated by spaces.

For example, `get_numbers(5)` would return the string `"0 1 2 3 4"`.</s>  ```
def get_numbers(n):
    return " ".join(str(i) for i in range(n))
```
This code uses a list comprehension to generate a list of strings, where each string is the string representation of an integer in the range [0, n). The list is then joined together using the " ".join() method to produce a single string containing space-delimited numbers.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```
print(get_numbers(5)) # Output: "0 1 2 3 4"
```</s>  ```
def get_numbers(n):
    return " ".join(str(i) for i in range(n))
```
Explanation:

The `range` function generates a sequence of numbers from 0 to `n-1`, and the `join` method is used to concatenate them into a string separated by spaces. The `str` function is used to convert each number to a string.</s>  ```
def get_numbers_upto_n(n):
    return " ".join(map(str, range(n)))
```
Explanation:

The `range` function generates a sequence of numbers from 0 to `n-1`. The `map` function applies the `str` function to each number in the sequence, converting it to a string. The `join` function then concatenates all the strings with a space in between.

For example, if `n` is 5, the function will return the string "0 1 2 3 4".</s>  ```
def get_numbers(n):
    return " ".join(str(i) for i in range(n))
```
This function uses the built-in `range` function to generate a sequence of numbers from 0 to `n-1`, and then joins them together into a string using spaces as the delimiter.

Here are a few examples of how the function would work:
```
>>> get_numbers(5)
'0 1 2 3 4'

>>> get_numbers(10)
'0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9'

>>> get_numbers(0)
''
```</s>  ```
def get_numbers(n):
    return " ".join(str(i) for i in range(n))
```
This code uses a list comprehension to generate a list of strings containing the numbers from 0 to `n-1`, and then joins them together with spaces using the `join` method.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```
print(get_numbers(5))  # Output: "0 1 2 3 4"
```</s>  ```
def generate_numbers(n):
    return " ".join(str(i) for i in range(n))
```
Explanation:

The `range` function generates a sequence of numbers from 0 to `n-1`. The `join` method is used to join the elements of the sequence with a space character. The `str` function is used to convert each number to a string.

Test cases:

* `generate_numbers(5)` should return `"0 1 2 3 4"`
* `generate_numbers(10)` should return `"0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9"`
* `generate_numbers(0)` should return `""` (an empty string)</s>  ```
def get_numbers(n):
    return " ".join(str(i) for i in range(n))
```
Explanation:

* The `range` function generates a sequence of numbers from 0 to `n-1`.
* The `join` method is used to concatenate the elements of the sequence with a space character between them.
* The `str` function is used to convert each number to a string.

Example usage:
```
>>> get_numbers(5)
'0 1 2 3 4'
```</s>  ```
def get_numbers(n):
    return " ".join(str(i) for i in range(n))
```
Explanation:

The `range` function returns a sequence of numbers from 0 to n-1. The `join` method is used to join the elements of this sequence into a string, with each element separated by a space. The `str` function is used to convert each number to a string before joining them together.

Example:
```
>>> get_numbers(5)
'0 1 2 3 4'
