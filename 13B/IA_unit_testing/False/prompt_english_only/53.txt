In this test suite, we have 13 tests for the addition function. Each test has two inputs: "x" and "y", which are the values to be added together. The expected output of each test is the sum of the two inputs. We have tested a variety of different input combinations to ensure that the function works correctly for all possible values of x and y.</s>  ```
import sys

x = int(sys.argv[1])
y = int(sys.argv[2])

print(x + y)
```</s>  ```
def add_two_numbers(x, y):
    return x + y
```
This code defines a function called `add_two_numbers` that takes two parameters `x` and `y` and returns their sum.

Here are some examples of how the function can be used:
```
print(add_two_numbers(3, 5))  # Output: 8
print(add_two_numbers(10, 2))  # Output: 12
print(add_two_numbers(4, 9))  # Output: 13
```
Note that the function does not use any modules.</s>  ```
def add_two_numbers(x, y):
    return x + y
```
This code defines a function `add_two_numbers` that takes two arguments `x` and `y` and returns their sum. The function uses the `+` operator to perform the addition.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```
>>> add_two_numbers(3, 5)
8
```</s>  ```
def add(x, y):
    return x + y
```
This code defines a function called `add` that takes two parameters `x` and `y` and returns their sum. The `return` statement specifies the value that should be returned when the function is called.

To test the function, we can call it with two different values for `x` and `y` and verify that the result is correct:
```
assert add(1, 2) == 3
assert add(3, 4) == 7
```
The `assert` statement checks that the expression following it is true. If it is not true, an AssertionError is raised.

Note that this code only defines the function `add` and does not include any test cases. If you want to test the function, you will need to call it with different values for `x` and `y` and verify that the result is correct.</s>  ```
def add(x, y):
    return x + y
```
This code defines a function `add` that takes two arguments `x` and `y` and returns their sum. The `+` operator is used to add the two numbers.

Here is an example of how you can use the `add` function:
```
x = 3
y = 5
result = add(x, y)
print(result)  # prints 8
```
This code assigns the value 3 to the variable `x` and the value 5 to the variable `y`. It then calls the `add` function with `x` and `y` as arguments, and assigns the result to the variable `result`. Finally, it prints the value of `result`.

Note that the `add` function is not limited to adding two numbers. It can be used to add any two values that support the `+` operator, such as strings or lists.</s>  ```
def add_numbers(x, y):
    return x + y
```
This function takes two integers as input and returns their sum as an integer. It does not use any modules and is written in a functional style.

Here are some test cases to demonstrate the functionality of the code:
```
print(add_numbers(3, 5))  # Output: 8
print(add_numbers(10, 2))  # Output: 12
print(add_numbers(100, 50))  # Output: 150
```
Note that this function only works with integers as input and returns an integer as output. If you need to work with floating-point numbers or other data types, you may need to modify the function accordingly.</s>  ```
def add_two_numbers(x, y):
    return x + y
```
This function takes two numbers as input and returns their sum. It does not use any external modules and obeys the constraints of the problem.

Test cases:

```
print(add_two_numbers(3, 5))  # 8
print(add_two_numbers(10, 2))  # 12
print(add_two_numbers(-3, 2))  # -1
```
The first test case checks that the function returns the correct result for two positive numbers. The second test case checks that the function returns the correct result for a positive and a negative number. The third test case checks that the function returns the correct result for two negative numbers.</s>  ```
def add_numbers(x, y):
    return x + y
```
This code defines a function called `add_numbers` that takes two parameters `x` and `y`. The function returns the sum of `x` and `y`.

Here is an example of how the function can be used:
```
print(add_numbers(3, 5))
```
This will output `8`.

This function can be used to add any two numbers, not just integers. For example:
```
print(add_numbers(3.5, 5.2))
```
This will output `8.7`.

Note that the `add_numbers` function does not handle any errors or edge cases. For example, if the user inputs a non-numeric value, the function will throw an error. It is up to the user to ensure that the input values are valid before calling the `add_numbers` function.</s>  ```
def add(x, y):
    return x + y
```
This code defines a function `add` that takes two arguments `x` and `y` and returns their sum. The function uses the `+` operator to add the two numbers.

Here is an example usage of the function:
```
print(add(3, 5))  # prints 8
```
This code calls the `add` function with the arguments `3` and `5`, and prints the result. The function returns `8`, which is the sum of `3` and `5`.</s>  ```
def add(x, y):
    return x + y
```
This code defines a function called `add` that takes two arguments `x` and `y` and returns their sum. The `return` statement is used to return the result of the addition.

The function can be tested as follows:
```
print(add(3, 4))  # Output: 7
print(add(5, 6))  # Output: 11
```
The code passes the test cases and returns the correct result.</s>
