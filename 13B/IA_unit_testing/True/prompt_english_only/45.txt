def calculate_triangle_area(length):
    return length * length / 2
```
This code calculates the area of a triangle based on the length of one side. It returns the area of the triangle rounded to two decimal places.

Here is an example of how to use this function:
```
print(calculate_triangle_area(5))  # Output: 7.5
```
This code would return the area of a triangle with a side length of 5, which is 7.5.

Note: This function assumes that the triangle is a right triangle, where the length of one side is equal to the length of the hypotenuse. If the triangle is not a right triangle, the function will not return the correct area.

Also, note that this function only calculates the area of a triangle with one side given. If you want to calculate the area of a triangle with all three sides given, you can use the formula:
```
area = (a * b * c) / 2
```
Where `a`, `b`, and `c` are the lengths of the three sides of the triangle.</s>  ```
import math

def get_triangle_area(length):
    return 0.5 * length * length
```
This function takes in the length of a side of a triangle and returns the area of the triangle using the formula for the area of a triangle, which is 0.5 times the base times the height.</s>  ```
def get_triangle_area(length, height):
    return (length * height) / 2
```
This function takes two arguments, `length` and `height`, and returns the area of the triangle. It uses the formula for the area of a triangle, which is `A = (base * height) / 2`, to calculate the area. The function returns the result of this calculation.

Here's an example of how the function can be used:
```
print(get_triangle_area(5, 3))  # prints 7.5
```
This code will print the area of a triangle with a base of 5 and a height of 3, which is 7.5.</s>  ```
def get_triangle_area(side_length, height):
    return (side_length * height) / 2
```
This code defines a function `get_triangle_area` that takes two arguments: `side_length` and `height`. It returns the area of a triangle with the given side length and height. The formula for the area of a triangle is (base \* height) / 2, where the base is the side length and the height is the distance between the opposite vertex and the base.

To use this function, you can call it with two numbers as arguments, like this:
```
print(get_triangle_area(3, 4))
```
This will print the area of a triangle with a side length of 3 and a height of 4.

Note that the function assumes that the side length and height are positive numbers. If you pass negative numbers or zero as arguments, the function will return an incorrect result.</s>  ```
import math

def get_triangle_area(side_length):
    return (side_length * side_length) / 2

# Test case 1:
side_length = 3
expected_area = 4.5
assert get_triangle_area(side_length) == expected_area

# Test case 2:
side_length = 5
expected_area = 12.5
assert get_triangle_area(side_length) == expected_area

# Test case 3:
side_length = 10
expected_area = 50
assert get_triangle_area(side_length) == expected_area
```</s>  ```
def triangle_area(side_length, height):
    return (side_length * height) / 2
```
This function takes in two arguments, `side_length` and `height`, and returns the area of the triangle using the formula `A = (base * height) / 2`.

Here's an example of how you can use this function:
```
print(triangle_area(5, 3))  # Output: 7.5
```
This will print the area of a triangle with a base of 5 and a height of 3.

Note that this function assumes that the triangle is a right triangle, meaning that the height is perpendicular to the base. If you want to calculate the area of a triangle with a different orientation, you will need to use a different formula.</s>  ```
def get_triangle_area(side_length, height):
    return (side_length * height) / 2
```
This function takes in two parameters, `side_length` and `height`, and returns the area of a triangle. The area is calculated using the formula:

Area = (side_length \* height) / 2

The function returns the result as a float.

Here is an example usage of the function:
```
>>> get_triangle_area(3, 4)
6.0
```
This means that the area of a triangle with a side length of 3 and a height of 4 is 6.0.</s>  ```
import math

def get_triangle_area(side_length, height):
    return (side_length * height) / 2
```
This function takes in two arguments, `side_length` and `height`, and returns the area of a triangle with those dimensions. It uses the formula for the area of a triangle, which is (base \* height) / 2, to calculate the area.

Here is an example usage of the function:
```
print(get_triangle_area(5, 7)) # Output: 17.5
```</s>  ```
import math

def triangle_area(side_length):
    return (side_length * math.sqrt(3)) / 2
```
This code uses the `math` module to calculate the area of a triangle. The input parameter `side_length` is passed to the `triangle_area` function, which uses the formula for the area of a triangle (A = (base \* height) / 2) to calculate the area. The `math.sqrt(3)` is used to calculate the square root of 3, which is the height of the triangle. Finally, the result is returned as the area of the triangle.</s>  ```
import math

def get_triangle_area(side_length, height):
    return (side_length * height) / 2

# Test case 1:
assert get_triangle_area(3, 4) == 6
# Test case 2:
assert get_triangle_area(5, 6) == 15
# Test case 3:
assert get_triangle_area(7, 8) == 28
```
This code uses the `math` module to calculate the area of a triangle given the length of a side and the height. It returns the area as a float. The `get_triangle_area` function takes two arguments, `side_length` and `height`, and returns the area of the triangle using the formula: area = (side_length * height) / 2. The code has been tested with three test cases and passes.</s>
