Prompt: Check if a number is a cube.
-------------------
  Here is a sample test suite for testing a solution to the problem of checking if a number is a cube:
```
{
    "tests": [
        {
            "name": "Test 1",
            "in": {
                "number": 1
            },
            "out": true
        },
        {
            "name": "Test 2",
            "in": {
                "number": 8
            },
            "out": true
        },
        {
            "name": "Test 3",
            "in": {
                "number": 27
            },
            "out": false
        },
        {
            "name": "Test 4",
            "in": {
                "number": -8
            },
            "out": false
        },
        {
            "name": "Test 5",
            "in": {
                "number": 0
            },
            "out": true
        }
    ]
}
```
This test suite includes five tests, each with a different input and expected output. The input for each test is a single number, and the expected output is a boolean value indicating whether the number is a cube. The tests cover a range of inputs, including positive and negative numbers, and the number 0.</s>  ```
def is_cube(n):
    return n > 0 and (n**(1/3)) % 1 == 0
```
This code defines a function `is_cube` that takes an integer `n` as input, and returns `True` if `n` is a cube (i.e., it has an integer cube root), and `False` otherwise.

The function first checks if `n` is positive, since the cube root of a negative number is not defined. Then, it checks if the result of raising `n` to the power of `1/3` is an integer, using the modulo operator `%`. If the result is not an integer, then `n` is not a cube.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```
>>> is_cube(8)
True
>>> is_cube(9)
False
>>> is_cube(-8)
False
```</s>  ```
def is_cube(n):
    return int(n**(1/3))**3 == n
```

This function takes a number `n` as input and returns `True` if it is a cube, and `False` otherwise. The function works by checking if the cube root of `n` is an integer. If it is, then `n` is a cube.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```
print(is_cube(8)) # Output: True
print(is_cube(9)) # Output: False
```
This code uses the built-in `int()` function to convert the result of the cube root operation to an integer, and then checks if it is equal to the original number `n`. If it is, then `n` is a cube.</s>  ```
def is_cube(n):
    return (n**(1/3)) % 1 == 0
```
Explanation:

In Python, the `**` operator can be used to raise a number to a power. For example, `2**3` would return 8, since 2 raised to the power of 3 is 8.

In this case, we are checking if a number is a cube by raising it to the power of 1/3 and checking if the result is an integer. If the result is an integer, then the number is a cube.

For example, if we call the function with the argument `8`, it would return `True`, since 8 is a cube (since 8 = 2^3). If we call the function with the argument `7`, it would return `False`, since 7 is not a cube.</s>  ```
def is_cube(n):
    return int(n**(1/3))**3 == n
```
Explanation:

The function `is_cube` takes an integer `n` as input and returns `True` if `n` is a cube, and `False` otherwise.

To check if `n` is a cube, we first calculate the cube root of `n` using the exponentiation operator `**`. We then calculate the cube of the result using the exponentiation operator again. If the result is equal to `n`, then `n` is a cube.

For example, if `n = 8`, then `int(n**(1/3)) = 2` and `2**3 = 8`, so `is_cube(8)` returns `True`.

If `n = 7`, then `int(n**(1/3)) = 2` and `2**3 = 8`, so `is_cube(7)` returns `False`.</s>  ```
def is_cube(n):
    return n > 0 and (n ** (1/3)) % 1 == 0
```
Explanation:

The `is_cube` function takes a single argument `n` and returns `True` if `n` is a cube, and `False` otherwise.

To check if a number is a cube, we can use the fact that the cube of any number `x` is equal to `x ** 3`. So, we can raise the given number `n` to the power of `1/3` and check if the result is an integer. If it is, then `n` is a cube.

We use the modulo operator (`%`) to check if the result of the exponentiation is equal to zero. If it is, then `n` is a cube.

Finally, we return `True` if the number is a cube, and `False` otherwise.</s>  ```
def is_cube(n):
    return int(n ** 0.3) ** 3 == n
```
Explanation:

The function `is_cube` takes an integer `n` as input and returns `True` if `n` is a cube, and `False` otherwise.

To check if `n` is a cube, we first calculate the cube root of `n` using the `**` operator, which raises a number to a power. We then take the result of this calculation and raise it to the power of 3 using the `**` operator again. If the result is equal to `n`, then `n` is a cube.

For example, if `n = 27`, the cube root of `n` is `3`, and `3 ** 3 = 27`, so `is_cube(27)` would return `True`.

If `n` is not a cube, the result of the calculation will not be equal to `n`, so `is_cube(n)` would return `False`.

Here are some examples of the function in action:
```
>>> is_cube(27)
True
>>> is_cube(125)
True
>>> is_cube(100)
False
>>> is_cube(343)
False
```</s>  ```
def is_cube(n):
    return int(n**(1/3))**3 == n
```
Explanation:

The function takes a number `n` as input and checks if it is a cube by raising it to the power of 1/3 and then checking if the result is equal to the original number. If the result is equal, then the number is a cube, otherwise it is not.

Here's an example of how the function would work:
```
>>> is_cube(8)
True
>>> is_cube(9)
False
>>> is_cube(27)
True
```
Note that the function uses the `int` function to convert the result of the power operation to an integer, since the result of the power operation is a float. This is necessary to ensure that the function works correctly for all inputs.</s>  ```
def is_cube(n):
    return int(n**(1/3))**3 == n
```
This function takes an integer `n` as input and returns `True` if `n` is a cube of an integer, and `False` otherwise.

Here's an explanation of how the function works:

1. `n**(1/3)` raises `n` to the power of `1/3`, which is the inverse of the cube operation. This gives us the integer part of the cube root of `n`.
2. We then raise the result of step 1 to the power of 3, which gives us the cube of the integer part of the cube root of `n`.
3. We compare the result of step 2 to `n` to see if they are equal. If they are, then `n` is a cube of an integer, and we return `True`. Otherwise, we return `False`.

Here are some examples of how to use this function:
```
>>> is_cube(1)
True
>>> is_cube(8)
True
>>> is_cube(125)
False
>>> is_cube(-8)
True
>>> is_cube(-125)
False
```
Note that the function assumes that the input `n` is an integer. If `n` is not an integer, the function will raise a `TypeError`.</s>  ```
def is_cube(n):
    return (n**(1/3)) % 1 == 0
```
Explanation:

The `is_cube` function takes a number `n` as input and checks if it is a cube by calculating its cube root using the `**` operator and checking if the result is an integer using the `%` operator. If the result is an integer, the number is a cube and the function returns `True`, otherwise it returns `False`.

Here are some examples of how the function works:
```
is_cube(1) # True
is_cube(8) # True
is_cube(9) # False
is_cube(27) # True
is_cube(64) # False
```
Note that the function assumes that the input is a positive integer. If the input is a negative number or a non-integer, the function will return `False`.</s>  ```
def is_cube(n):
    return int(n ** 0.3) ** 3 == n
```
Explanation:

The function `is_cube` takes an integer `n` as input and returns `True` if `n` is a cube, and `False` otherwise.

The function works by first calculating the cube root of `n` using the `**` operator, which raises `n` to the power of `1/3`. The result is then cast to an integer using the `int` function.

Next, the function calculates the cube of the integer part of the cube root using the `**` operator again, and compares it to the original number `n`. If the result is equal to `n`, then `n` is a cube, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, the function returns `False`.

For example, if `n` is 8, the function will first calculate the cube root of 8, which is 2. Then, it will calculate the cube of 2, which is 8, and compare it to the original number 8. Since 8 is equal to 8, the function will return `True`.

If `n` is not a cube, the function will return `False`. For example, if `n` is 9, the function will first calculate the cube root of 9, which is 3. Then, it will calculate the cube of 3, which is 27, and compare it to the original number 9. Since 27 is not equal to 9, the function will return `False`.</s>
