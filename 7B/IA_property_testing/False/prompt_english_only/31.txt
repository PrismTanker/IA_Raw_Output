This test suite uses the Hypothesis library to generate random test cases for the candidate function. It defines two property tests:

1. `property_1`: This test checks that the candidate function returns `True` for prime numbers and `False` for non-prime numbers. It generates random integers between 1 and 100 and checks that the candidate function returns the correct value.
2. `property_2`: This test checks that the candidate function returns the same result for positive and negative numbers. It generates random integers between -100 and 100 and checks that the candidate function returns the same value for both positive and negative inputs.

The `given` decorator is used to specify the input data for each test case. The `strategies` module provides a range of predefined strategies for generating random test data, including `strategies.integers()` for generating random integers. The `assert` statement is used to verify that the candidate function returns the correct result for each test case.</s>  ```
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):

This code uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to determine if a given number is prime. It starts by checking if the number is less than 2, and if it is not, it iterates over the numbers from 2 to the square root of the number and checks if the number is divisible by any of them. If it is divisible by any of them, it returns False, indicating that the number is not prime. If it makes it to the end of the loop without finding any divisors, it returns True, indicating that the number is prime.</s>  Here is a Python function that returns true if a given number is prime, and false otherwise:
```
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```
This function uses a simple algorithm to check if a number is prime. It starts by checking if the number is less than 2, and if it is, it returns false. If the number is greater than or equal to 2, it loops through all the numbers between 2 and the square root of the number (inclusive) and checks if any of them divide the number without leaving a remainder. If any of these checks return true, the function returns false, indicating that the number is not prime. If none of the checks return true, the function returns true, indicating that the number is prime.

For example, if we call the function with the argument 13, it will return true, indicating that 13 is prime. If we call the function with the argument 14, it will return false, indicating that 14 is not prime.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.</s>  ```

This code uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to check if a given number is prime. It iterates from 2 to the square root of the number and checks if the number is divisible by any of the numbers in the range. If it finds a divisor, it returns False, otherwise it returns True.</s>  ```

This code uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to determine if a given number is prime. It starts by checking if the number is less than 2, since all numbers less than 2 are not prime. If the number is greater than or equal to 2, it uses a loop to iterate through the numbers 2 to the square root of the number, and checks if any of those numbers divide the given number without leaving a remainder. If a divisor is found, the number is not prime and the function returns False. If the loop completes without finding a divisor, the number is prime and the function returns True.</s>
