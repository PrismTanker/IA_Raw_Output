def is_cube(n):
    return int(n**(1/3))**3 == n
```
Explanation:

The `int()` function is used to convert the result of `n**(1/3)` to an integer. This is necessary because the result of `n**(1/3)` may not be exactly equal to the cube root of `n`, due to rounding errors. By converting the result to an integer, we ensure that the comparison with `n` is done using the exact value of the cube root.

For example, if `n = 27`, then `n**(1/3)` is approximately 3.0000000000000004, which is not equal to 3. By converting the result to an integer, we get 3, which is equal to 27.

The `**3` operator is used to compute the cube of the integer part of `n**(1/3)`. This is necessary because the cube root of `n` may not be an integer. For example, if `n = 26`, then `n**(1/3)` is approximately 3.090169943749474, which is not equal to 3. By computing the cube of the integer part of `n**(1/3)`, we get 27, which is equal to 26.

The `==` operator is used to compare the result of `n**(1/3)` with `n`. If the result is equal to `n`, then `n` is the cube of an integer.

For example, if `n = 27`, then `n**(1/3)` is 3, and `3**3` is 27. Therefore, `is_cube(27)` returns `True`.

If `n` is not the cube of an integer, then `is_cube(n)` returns `False`. For example, if `n = 26`, then `n**(1/3)` is approximately 3.090169943749474, and `3.090169943749474**3` is not equal to 26. Therefore, `is_cube(26)` returns `False`.</s>  ```
def is_cube(n):
    return int(n**(1/3))**3 == n
```
Explanation:

The function `is_cube` takes an integer `n` as input and returns `True` if `n` is the cube of an integer, and `False` otherwise.

The function first calculates the cube root of `n` using the exponentiation operator `**`, and then raises the result to the power of 3. If the result is equal to `n`, then `n` is the cube of an integer, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, the function returns `False`.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```
>>> is_cube(8)
True
>>> is_cube(7)
False
```</s>  ```
def is_cube(n):
    return int(n**(1/3))**3 == n
```
Explanation:

The function `is_cube` takes an integer `n` as input and returns `True` if `n` is the cube of an integer, and `False` otherwise.

The function first calculates the cube root of `n` using the exponentiation operator `**`. It then checks if the result of the cube root is equal to `n` by comparing the result to `n`. If the result is equal to `n`, then `n` is the cube of an integer, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, the function returns `False`.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```
print(is_cube(8)) # Output: True
print(is_cube(16)) # Output: False
```
Note that the function assumes that `n` is a positive integer. If `n` can be negative, you may need to modify the function to handle negative integers as well.</s>  ```
def is_cube(n):
    return int(n ** (1/3)) ** 3 == n
```
This function takes a number `n` as input and returns `True` if `n` is a cube of an integer, and `False` otherwise.

Here's an explanation of how the function works:

1. `n ** (1/3)` calculates the cube root of `n`. For example, `4 ** (1/3)` is equal to 2.
2. `int(n ** (1/3))` rounds the result of the previous step down to the nearest integer. For example, if `n` is 8, then `int(8 ** (1/3))` is equal to 2.
3. The result of the previous step is then raised to the power of 3 using the `**` operator. For example, if `n` is 8, then `(int(8 ** (1/3)) ** 3` is equal to 8.
4. The result of the previous step is compared to the original input `n` using the `==` operator. If they are equal, then `n` is a cube of an integer, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, the function returns `False`.

Here's an example of how to use this function:
```
>>> is_cube(8)
True
>>> is_cube(7)
False
```</s>  ```
def is_cube(n):
    return int(n**(1/3))**3 == n
```
Explanation:

The function `is_cube` takes an integer `n` as input and returns `True` if `n` is the cube of an integer, and `False` otherwise.

To check if `n` is the cube of an integer, we first compute `n**(1/3)`, which gives us the integer part of the cube root of `n`. We then compute the cube of this integer part using `**3`, and compare it to `n` to see if they are equal. If they are equal, then `n` is the cube of an integer.

Here are some examples:
```
>>> is_cube(1)
True
>>> is_cube(8)
True
>>> is_cube(27)
True
>>> is_cube(16)
False
>>> is_cube(4)
False
```
Note that this function assumes that `n` is a non-negative integer. If `n` can be negative, you may need to modify the function accordingly.</s>  ```
def is_cube(n):
    return int(n**(1/3))**3 == n
```
Explanation:

The function `is_cube` takes an integer `n` as input and returns `True` if `n` is a cube of an integer, and `False` otherwise.

The function first checks if `n` is a perfect cube by taking the cube root of `n` and checking if it is an integer. If it is not an integer, then `n` is not a cube of an integer and the function returns `False`.

If `n` is a perfect cube, then the function takes the integer part of the cube root of `n` and raises it to the power of 3. If the result is equal to `n`, then `n` is a cube of an integer and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, `n` is not a cube of an integer and the function returns `False`.

Here is an example usage of the function:
```
>>> is_cube(8)
True
>>> is_cube(10)
False
>>> is_cube(27)
True
```</s>  ```
def is_cube(n):
    return int(n**(1/3))**3 == n
```
Explanation:

The `is_cube` function takes an integer `n` as input and returns `True` if `n` is a cube of an integer, and `False` otherwise.

The function first checks if `n` is a perfect cube by raising it to the power of `1/3` and checking if the result is an integer. If it is, then the function returns `True`. If it is not, then the function returns `False`.

Here's an example of how to use the `is_cube` function:
```
print(is_cube(8)) # Output: True
print(is_cube(10)) # Output: False
```</s>  ```
def is_cube(n):
    return int(n**(1/3))**3 == n
```
Explanation:

The `is_cube` function takes a number `n` as input and returns `True` if `n` is a cube of an integer, and `False` otherwise.

The function first checks if `n` is a perfect cube by taking the cube root of `n` using the `**` operator. If the result is an integer, then `n` is a cube of an integer, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, the function returns `False`.

For example, if `n` is 8, then `n**(1/3)` is 2, which is an integer, so `is_cube(8)` returns `True`. If `n` is 9, then `n**(1/3)` is 3, which is not an integer, so `is_cube(9)` returns `False`.</s>  ```
def is_cube(n):
    return int(n**(1/3))**3 == n
```
Explanation:

The `is_cube` function takes a number `n` as input and returns `True` if `n` is the cube of an integer, and `False` otherwise.

The function first computes the cube root of `n` using the `**` operator, which is the same as raising `n` to the power of `1/3`. The result is then converted to an integer using the `int()` function.

Next, the function checks if the integer part of the cube root is equal to `n`. If it is, then `n` is the cube of an integer, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, the function returns `False`.

Here are some examples of how the function works:

* `is_cube(8)` returns `True` because `8` is the cube of `2`.
* `is_cube(9)` returns `False` because `9` is not the cube of an integer.
* `is_cube(27)` returns `True` because `27` is the cube of `3`.

Note that the function only checks if `n` is the cube of an integer, and does not check if `n` is a perfect cube (i.e., if `n` has no fractional part). If you need to check if `n` is a perfect cube, you can modify the function as follows:
```
def is_perfect_cube(n):
    return int(n**(1/3))**3 == n and n % 1 == 0
```
This function first checks if `n` is the cube of an integer using the same method as before. If it is, it then checks if `n` has no fractional part using the modulo operator (`%`). If `n` has no fractional part, the function returns `True`, otherwise it returns `False`.</s>  ```
def is_cube(n):
    return int(n**(1/3))**3 == n
```
Explanation:

1. The `n**(1/3)` expression calculates the cube root of `n`.
2. The `int()` function rounds the result down to the nearest integer.
3. The resulting integer is then raised to the power of 3, which is the same as the original number if it is a perfect cube, and a different number otherwise.
4. The equality comparison checks if the result is equal to the original number. If it is, then `n` is a perfect cube, otherwise it is not.</s>
