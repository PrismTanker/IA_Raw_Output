def closest_integer(number_string):
    number = float(number_string)
    closest_int = round(number)
    if abs(closest_int - number) == 0.5:
        closest_int = int(closest_int // 1)
    return closest_int
```
This function takes a string representing a number as input, converts it to a float, and then rounds it to the closest integer using the `round()` function. If the number is equidistant from two integers, it rounds away from zero by using the `//` operator to perform integer division and then converting the result to an integer. The final result is returned as an integer.

For example, if the input is `'3.8'`, the output will be `4`. If the input is `'-3.5'`, the output will be `-4`.</s>  ```
def closest_integer(number_string):
    number = float(number_string)
    closest_int = round(number)
    if abs(closest_int - number) == abs(closest_int + 1 - number):
        closest_int += 1
    return closest_int
```
This function takes a string representing a number as input, converts it to a float, and then uses the built-in `round()` function to round it to the closest integer. If the number is equidistant from two integers, it rounds it away from zero by adding 1 to the result.

For example, if the input is "1.5", the output will be 2, and if the input is "1.25", the output will be 1.

Note that this function assumes that the input string is a valid number and will raise a `ValueError` if the input is not a valid number.</s>  Here is a function that takes a string representing a number and returns the closest integer to it:
```
def closest_integer(number_string):
    number = float(number_string)
    if number - int(number) == 0.5:
        return int(number)
    else:
        return int(round(number))
```
This function first converts the input string to a floating-point number using the `float()` function. It then checks if the number is equidistant from two integers by comparing it to the fractional part of the number, which is the part after the decimal point. If the fractional part is exactly 0.5, then the number is equidistant from two integers and the function returns the integer part of the number. Otherwise, the function rounds the number using the `round()` function and returns the result as an integer.

Here is an example usage of this function:
```
print(closest_integer('1.2')) # Output: 1
print(closest_integer('1.8')) # Output: 2
print(closest_integer('-1.2')) # Output: -1
print(closest_integer('-1.8')) # Output: -2
```
This function is useful when you need to convert a string representing a number to an integer, while also handling cases where the number is equidistant from two integers.</s>  ```
def closest_integer(number_string):
    number = float(number_string)
    closest_int = round(number)
    if abs(closest_int - number) == 0.5:
        closest_int = 0 if closest_int > 0 else 1
    return closest_int
```
This function takes a string representing a number as input and returns the closest integer to it. It uses the `float()` function to convert the string to a float, then the `round()` function to round the float to the nearest integer. If the number is equidistant from two integers, it rounds it away from zero.

For example, if the input is "1.5", the output will be 2. If the input is "2.5", the output will be 3.

Note that this function does not handle cases where the input is not a valid number string, such as "abc" or "1.2.3". It is important to handle such cases in your own code if you are using this function in a larger program.</s>  ```
def closest_integer(number_string):
    number = float(number_string)
    diff = abs(number - round(number))
    if diff == 0.5:
        return 0 if number < 0 else 1
    else:
        return round(number)
```
This function first converts the input string to a floating-point number using the `float()` function. It then calculates the difference between the number and its nearest integer using the `abs()` function. If the difference is exactly 0.5, the number is equidistant from two integers, so the function returns 0 if the number is negative and 1 if it is positive. Otherwise, the function rounds the number to the nearest integer using the `round()` function and returns the result.</s>  ```
def round_to_closest_integer(number_string):
    number = float(number_string)
    if number - int(number) == 0.5:
        return int(number) + 1
    else:
        return int(round(number))
```
This function takes a string representing a number as input, converts it to a float, and then checks if the number is equidistant from two integers. If it is, the function returns the integer that is closest to the number and is away from zero. Otherwise, the function returns the integer that is closest to the number.

For example, if the input is "1.2", the function will return 1, because 1 is the closest integer to 1.2 and is away from zero. If the input is "1.8", the function will return 2, because 2 is the closest integer to 1.8 and is away from zero.</s>  ```
def closest_integer(number_string):
    number = float(number_string)
    closest_int = round(number)
    if abs(closest_int - number) == abs(closest_int + 1 - number):
        closest_int += 1
    return closest_int
```
Explanation:

* First, we convert the input string to a floating-point number using the `float()` function.
* We then round the number to the closest integer using the `round()` function.
* If the rounded number is equidistant from two integers, we add 1 to it to make it closer to the original number.
* Finally, we return the rounded integer.

Test cases:

* `closest_integer("1.2")` should return `1`
* `closest_integer("2.8")` should return `3`
* `closest_integer("-1.2")` should return `-1`
* `closest_integer("-2.8")` should return `-3`
* `closest_integer("0.5")` should return `1`
* `closest_integer("-0.5")` should return `-1`
* `closest_integer("2.5")` should return `3`
* `closest_integer("-2.5")` should return `-3`
* `closest_integer("-1.5")` should return `-1`
* `closest_integer("1.5")` should return `2`

Note: The `abs()` function is used to calculate the absolute value of a number.</s>  ```
def closest_integer(number_str):
    number = float(number_str)
    if abs(number - round(number)) < 0.5:
        return int(round(number))
    else:
        return 1 if number > 0 else -1
```
This function first converts the input string to a float using the `float()` function. It then uses the `abs()` function to calculate the distance between the number and its nearest integer. If the distance is less than 0.5, the number is rounded to the nearest integer using the `round()` function. If the distance is greater than 0.5, the number is rounded away from zero. Finally, the function returns the rounded integer.</s>  ```
def closest_integer(number_string):
    number = float(number_string)
    closest_int = round(number)
    if abs(closest_int - number) == abs(closest_int + 1 - number):
        closest_int += 1
    return closest_int
```
This function takes a string representing a number as input, converts it to a float, and then uses the `round()` function to round it to the closest integer. If the number is equidistant from two integers, it rounds it away from zero by adding 1 to the result. The result is then returned as an integer.</s>  ```
def closest_integer(num_str):
    num = float(num_str)
    if abs(num - round(num)) < abs(num - round(num) - 1):
        return round(num)
    else:
        return round(num) - 1
```
This function first converts the input string to a float using the `float()` function. It then checks whether the number is equidistant from two integers by comparing the absolute difference between the number and the rounded value to the absolute difference between the number and the rounded value minus 1. If the number is equidistant, it returns the rounded value minus 1. Otherwise, it returns the rounded value.

For example, if the input is "1.5", the function will return 1, since 1.5 is equidistant from 1 and 2. If the input is "2.5", the function will return 3, since 2.5 is equidistant from 2 and 3. If the input is "3.5", the function will return 4, since 3.5 is equidistant from 3 and 4.</s>
