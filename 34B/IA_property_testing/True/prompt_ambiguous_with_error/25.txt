Prompt: Return prime factors of a given integer.
-------------------
  Here is a possible test suite for the "prime factors" function using the Hypothesis library:
```
from hypothesis import given, strategies

def property_test(candidate_function):
    @given(strategies.integers(min_value=2))
    def property_1(n):
        factors = candidate_function(n)
        assert all(is_prime(factor) for factor in factors)

    @given(strategies.integers(min_value=2))
    def property_2(n):
        factors = candidate_function(n)
        assert all(factor <= n for factor in factors)

    return [property_1, property_2]

def is_prime(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```
This test suite includes two property tests:

1. `property_1` tests that all factors returned by the function are prime.
2. `property_2` tests that all factors returned by the function are less than or equal to the input number.

Both tests use the `given` decorator from Hypothesis to generate random input values for the function. The `strategies.integers` strategy is used to generate integers greater than or equal to 2.

The `is_prime` function is used to check if a given number is prime. It checks if the number is less than or equal to 1, and if it has any factors less than or equal to its square root.

The test suite returns a list containing the two property tests.</s>  ```
def get_prime_factors(n):
    factors = []
    while n % 2 == 0:
        factors.append(2)
        n //= 2
    for i in range(3, int(n ** 0.5) + 1, 2):
        while n % i == 0:
            factors.append(i)
            n //= i
    if n > 2:
        factors.append(n)
    return factors
```</s>  ```
def get_prime_factors(n):
    factors = []
    while n % 2 == 0:
        factors.append(2)
        n //= 2
    for i in range(3, int(n**0.5) + 1, 2):
        while n % i == 0:
            factors.append(i)
            n //= i
    if n > 2:
        factors.append(n)
    return factors
```
This function uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes to find the prime factors of a given integer `n`. The function first checks if `n` is even and repeatedly divides it by 2 while it is even, adding 2 to the list of prime factors. Then, it iterates over the odd numbers up to the square root of `n`, and for each odd number `i` that divides `n`, it adds `i` to the list of prime factors and divides `n` by `i`. Finally, if `n` is greater than 2, it adds `n` to the list of prime factors.

For example, to get the prime factors of 12, we can call the function like this:
```
get_prime_factors(12)
```
This will return the list `[2, 2, 3]`.</s>  ```
def get_prime_factors(n):
    factors = []
    while n % 2 == 0:
        factors.append(2)
        n //= 2
    for i in range(3, int(n**0.5) + 1, 2):
        while n % i == 0:
            factors.append(i)
            n //= i
    if n > 2:
        factors.append(n)
    return factors
```
This code uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes to find all prime factors of a given integer. The Sieve of Eratosthenes is an algorithm used to find all prime numbers up to a given number, n. The algorithm works by iteratively marking as composite (not prime) the multiples of each prime, starting with 2. The algorithm stops when the square root of n is reached, since any remaining numbers must be prime.

The function `get_prime_factors` takes an integer `n` as input and returns a list of prime factors of `n`. The function first checks if `n` is even, and if so, it repeatedly divides `n` by 2 until it is no longer even. Then, the function iterates from 3 to the square root of `n` in steps of 2, and for each number `i` in this range, it repeatedly divides `n` by `i` until `i` is no longer a factor of `n`. Finally, if `n` is greater than 2, the function adds `n` to the list of prime factors.

The function uses the `range` function to generate the sequence of numbers from 3 to the square root of `n` in steps of 2, and the `//=` operator to perform integer division and assign the result to `n`. The function also uses a list comprehension to generate the list of prime factors.

This function takes an integer `n` as input and returns a list of its prime factors. The function uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to find the prime factors.

Here's an explanation of how the code works:

1. The function starts by initializing an empty list `factors` to store the prime factors of `n`.
2. The function then checks if `n` is even by dividing it by 2 and storing the result in `n`. If `n` is even, the function appends 2 to the `factors` list.
3. The function then iterates from 3 to the square root of `n` in increments of 2, checking if `n` is divisible by each number in this range. If a number `i` divides `n`, the function appends `i` to the `factors` list and divides `n` by `i`.
4. After the loop finishes, the function checks if `n` is greater than 2. If it is, the function appends `n` to the `factors` list.
5. Finally, the function returns the `factors` list.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```
print(get_prime_factors(12))  # Output: [2, 2, 3]
print(get_prime_factors(15))  # Output: [3, 5]
print(get_prime_factors(24))  # Output: [2, 2, 2, 3]
```</s>  ```

This code uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to find all prime factors of a given integer `n`. The algorithm works by iteratively marking as composite (not prime) the multiples of each prime number up to the square root of `n`. The remaining numbers in the range `2` to `n` are the prime factors of `n`.

Here is an example usage of the function:
```
print(get_prime_factors(12)) # Output: [2, 2, 3]
print(get_prime_factors(15)) # Output: [3, 5]
