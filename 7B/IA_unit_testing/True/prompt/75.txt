Prompt: 
def is_multiply_prime(a):
    """Write a function that returns true if the given number is the multiplication of 3 prime numbers

-------------------
  Here is a sample test suite for the `is_multiply_prime` function:
```
{
    "test_multiply_of_3_prime_numbers": {
        "in": {
            "a": 30
        },
        "out": true
    },
    "test_not_multiply_of_3_prime_numbers": {
        "in": {
            "a": 20
        },
        "out": false
    },
    "test_less_than_100": {
        "in": {
            "a": 99
        },
        "out": true
    },
    "test_greater_than_100": {
        "in": {
            "a": 101
        },
        "out": false
    }
}
```
The test suite includes four tests:

1. `test_multiply_of_3_prime_numbers`: This test checks that the function returns `true` when the input number is the multiplication of three prime numbers.
2. `test_not_multiply_of_3_prime_numbers`: This test checks that the function returns `false` when the input number is not the multiplication of three prime numbers.
3. `test_less_than_100`: This test checks that the function returns `true` when the input number is less than 100.
4. `test_greater_than_100`: This test checks that the function returns `false` when the input number is greater than 100.

The test suite also includes some sample inputs and expected outputs for each test. The inputs are provided in the form of a JSON object, where the key is the name of the test and the value is the input to be passed to the function. The expected outputs are also provided in the form of JSON objects, where the key is the name of the test and the value is the expected output.</s>  Here's a solution to the problem:
```
def is_multiply_prime(a):
    if a < 100:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(a ** 0.5) + 1):
        if a % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```
This solution uses a simple loop to check if the given number is divisible by any number less than or equal to its square root. If it is divisible by a number less than or equal to its square root, it cannot be the multiplication of 3 prime numbers, so we return `False`. If the loop completes without finding any divisors, we return `True`, indicating that the number is the multiplication of 3 prime numbers.

Note that the solution assumes that the given number is less than 100, as specified in the problem. If the number can be larger, you may need to modify the solution accordingly.</s>
