-------------------
  Here is a test suite for the greatest common divisor function:
```

    "gcd_test1": {
        "in": {
            "a": 12,
            "b": 15
        },
        "out": 3
    },
    "gcd_test2": {
        "in": {
            "a": 10,
            "b": 15
        },
        "out": 5
    },
    "gcd_test3": {
        "in": {
            "a": 100,
            "b": 1000
        },
        "out": 100
    },
    "gcd_test4": {
        "in": {
            "a": 1000,
            "b": 10000
        },
        "out": 1000
    },
    "gcd_test5": {
        "in": {
            "a": 100000,
            "b": 1000000
        },
        "out": 100000
    }
}
```
This test suite includes five test cases, each with the input parameters `a` and `b` and the expected output `out`. The test cases are designed to cover a range of inputs and expected outputs, including small numbers, large numbers, and a mix of factors.</s>  ```
def gcd(a, b):
    while b != 0:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a
```
This function uses the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor of two integers. It works by repeatedly subtracting the smaller number from the larger number until the smaller number is 0, at which point the remaining number is the GCD.

Here's an example of how to use this function:
```
print(gcd(12, 15)) # Output: 3
print(gcd(10, 15)) # Output: 5
```
Note that this function assumes that both inputs are integers. If you want to handle non-integer inputs, you'll need to add additional logic to handle those cases.</s>  ```
def gcd(a, b):
    while b != 0:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a
```</s>  ```
def gcd(a, b):
    while b != 0:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a
```
This function uses the Euclidean algorithm to calculate the greatest common divisor of two integers. It starts by setting `a` to the larger number and `b` to the smaller number. Then, it repeatedly subtracts the smaller number from the larger number until the smaller number is 0, at which point the remaining number is the GCD.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```
print(gcd(12, 15)) # Output: 3
print(gcd(24, 30)) # Output: 6
```
This function is efficient because it only uses basic arithmetic operations and does not use any loops or recursion. It is also easy to understand and maintain.</s>  ```
def gcd(a, b):
    while b != 0:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a
```
This function uses the Euclidean algorithm to calculate the greatest common divisor of two integers. It starts by setting `a` and `b` to the inputs, then repeatedly replaces them with the remainder of `b` divided by `a` and the previous value of `b`, respectively, until `b` is equal to 0. At that point, `a` is the greatest common divisor of the original inputs.

Here's an example usage:
```
print(gcd(12, 15)) # Output: 3
```
This code uses the `while` loop to repeatedly divide `b` by `a` and update the values of `a` and `b` until `b` is equal to 0. The `return` statement at the end returns the final value of `a`, which is the greatest common divisor of the original inputs.</s>  ```
def gcd(a, b):
    while b != 0:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a
```
This code uses the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor of two integers. It works by repeatedly subtracting the smaller number from the larger number until the smaller number is 0, at which point the remaining number is the greatest common divisor.</s>  ```
def gcd(a, b):

        a, b = b, a % b
    return a
```
This function uses the Euclidean algorithm to calculate the greatest common divisor of two integers. It starts by setting `b` to the remainder of `a` divided by `b`, and then sets `a` to `b`. It continues this process until `b` is equal to 0, at which point `a` is the greatest common divisor.</s>  ```
def gcd(a, b):
    while b != 0:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a
```
Explanation:

The greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers `a` and `b` is the largest positive integer that divides both `a` and `b` without leaving a remainder.

The algorithm works as follows:

1. Initialize the GCD to 1.
2. While `b` is not 0, swap `a` and `b` and compute the remainder of `a` divided by `b`.
3. If the remainder is 0, return the GCD.
4. Otherwise, set `a` to the remainder and `b` to the previous value of `a`, and repeat step 2.

This algorithm is based on the fact that if `a` and `b` are not coprime, then the GCD of `a` and `b` is the same as the GCD of `b` and the remainder of `a` divided by `b`.

Here is an example of how the algorithm works:
```
gcd(12, 15) = gcd(15, 12 % 15) = gcd(15, 3) = 3
```
This means that the GCD of 12 and 15 is 3.</s>  ```
def gcd(a, b):
    while b != 0:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a
```</s>  ```
def gcd(a, b):
    while b != 0:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a
```
This function uses the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor of two integers. It works by repeatedly subtracting the smaller number from the larger number until the smaller number is 0, at which point the remaining number is the greatest common divisor.

Here is an example of how to use this function:
```
print(gcd(12, 15)) # Output: 3
```</s>  ```
def gcd(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a
```
This function uses the Euclidean algorithm to calculate the greatest common divisor of two integers. It starts by setting `b` to the remainder of `a` divided by `b`, and then sets `a` to `b`. This process continues until `b` is 0, at which point `a` is the greatest common divisor.

Here is an example of how this function works:
```
>>> gcd(12, 15)
3
```
In this example, `a` is 12 and `b` is 15. The function sets `b` to the remainder of `a` divided by `b`, which is 3. It then sets `a` to `b`, which is 3. The function continues this process until `b` is 0, at which point `a` is the greatest common divisor, which is 3.

This function obeys the constraints and passes the given test cases.</s>
