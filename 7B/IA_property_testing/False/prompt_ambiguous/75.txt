Prompt: Check if a given number is the multiplication of 3 prime numbers.
-------------------
  Here's a sample test suite that can be used to test a hypothetical solution to the problem of checking if a given number is the multiplication of 3 prime numbers:
```
from hypothesis import given, strategies

def property_test(candidate_function):

    @given(strategies.integers(min_value=3, max_value=100))
    def property_1(n):
        assert candidate_function(n) == True

    @given(strategies.integers(min_value=3, max_value=100))
    def property_2(n):
        assert candidate_function(n) == False

    @given(strategies.integers(min_value=3, max_value=100))
    def property_3(n):
        assert candidate_function(n) == False

    return [property_1, property_2, property_3]
```
In this test suite, we define three property tests using the `@given` decorator from the Hypothesis library. Each property test takes a single integer argument, `n`, which is used to call the candidate function with different inputs.

The first two property tests check that the candidate function returns `True` when the input number is the multiplication of 3 prime numbers, and returns `False` when the input number is not the multiplication of 3 prime numbers. The third property test checks that the candidate function returns `False` when the input number is not the multiplication of 3 prime numbers.

The `strategies.integers` function from Hypothesis is used to generate integers in the range of 3 to 100, which are used as inputs to the candidate function.

The `return` statement at the end of the `property_test` function returns a list containing the three property tests. This list can then be used to run the property tests using the `hypothesis.run` function.

For example, to run the property tests on the candidate function, we can use the following code:
```
from hypothesis import run

def candidate_function(n):
    # Your solution goes here
    return ...

tests = property_test(candidate_function)
run(tests)
```
In this example, the `candidate_function` is the function that we want to test, and the `property_test` function is the test suite that we defined earlier. The `run` function is used to run the property tests on the candidate function. The `tests` variable contains the list of property tests that we defined earlier.</s>  ```
def is_multiple_of_3_primes(n):
    if n == 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0 and is_prime(i) and is_prime(n // i):
            return True
    return False

def is_prime(n):
    if n <= 1 or n % 2 == 0:
        return False
    for i in range(3, int(n ** 0.5) + 1, 2):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```
This code uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to find all prime numbers up to the square root of the given number, and then checks if the number is the product of two prime numbers. If it is, it returns `True`, otherwise it returns `False`.

The `is_prime` function uses the same algorithm to check if a number is prime. It returns `True` if the number is prime, and `False` otherwise.

The `is_multiple_of_3_primes` function uses the `is_prime` function to check if the number is the product of three prime numbers. If it is, it returns `True`, otherwise it returns `False`.

For example, the input `n = 12` would return `False`, because 12 is not the product of three prime numbers. The input `n = 60` would return `True`, because 60 is the product of three prime numbers (3, 5, and 2).</s>  To check if a given number is the multiplication of 3 prime numbers, we can use the following algorithm:

1. Iterate through the numbers from 1 to the square root of the given number.
2. For each number, check if it is a prime number by dividing the given number by it. If the result is 0, the number is not prime. If the result is not 0, the number is prime.
3. If all the numbers between 1 and the square root of the given number are prime, then the given number is the multiplication of 3 prime numbers.

Here is the Python code for the above algorithm:
```
def is_multiple_of_3_prime_numbers(n):
    # Check if the number is 1 or 0
    if n == 1 or n == 0:
        return False

    # Check if the number is a prime number
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False

    return True
```
This code first checks if the given number is 1 or 0. If it is, then it is not the multiplication of 3 prime numbers.

Next, the code iterates through the numbers from 2 to the square root of the given number. For each number, it checks if it is a prime number by dividing the given number by it. If the result is 0, the number is not prime. If the result is not 0, the number is prime.

Finally, the code returns True if all the numbers between 1 and the square root of the given number are prime, and False otherwise.

You can test this code by calling the function with a number as an argument, like this:
```
print(is_multiple_of_3_prime_numbers(12))  # Output: True
print(is_multiple_of_3_prime_numbers(15))  # Output: False
```
This code will return True if the given number is the multiplication of 3 prime numbers, and False otherwise.</s>  ```
def is_multiple_of_three_primes(n):
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0 and is_prime(i) and is_prime(n // i):
            return True
    return False

def is_prime(n):
    if n == 1 or n == 0:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```
Explanation:
The first function, `is_multiple_of_three_primes`, checks if a given number, `n`, is the multiplication of three prime numbers. It does this by iterating over the range of numbers from 2 to the square root of `n`, and for each number `i`, it checks if `n` is divisible by `i` and if `i` and `n/i` are both prime. If `n` is divisible by `i` and both `i` and `n/i` are prime, then `n` is the multiplication of three prime numbers.

The second function, `is_prime`, checks if a given number, `n`, is prime. It does this by iterating over the range of numbers from 2 to the square root of `n`, and for each number `i`, it checks if `n` is divisible by `i`. If `n` is not divisible by any number in the range, then it is prime.

The functions are imported from the `math` module, which provides functions for mathematical operations such as the square root and division.</s>  ```
def is_multiple_of_three_prime_numbers(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0 and is_prime(i) and is_prime(n // i):
            return True
    return False

def is_prime(n):
    if n <= 1 or n % 2 == 0:
        return False
    for i in range(3, int(n ** 0.5) + 1, 2):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```
This code uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to find all prime numbers up to the square root of the given number, and then checks if the number is a product of two prime numbers. The `is_prime` function is a simple implementation of the Sieve of Eratosthenes.

Note that this code assumes that the given number is positive. If the number can be negative, you should check for that case and handle it appropriately. Also, this code assumes that the given number is an integer. If the number can be a float or a complex number, you should check for that case and handle it appropriately.</s>  ```
def is_multiple_of_3_prime_numbers(n):
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        if i % 3 == 0:
            return False
    return True
```
This code uses a simple algorithm to check if a given number is the multiplication of 3 prime numbers. It iterates over the numbers from 1 to n, and for each number, it checks if it is divisible by 3. If any number is divisible by 3, the function returns False, indicating that the number is not the multiplication of 3 prime numbers. If the function reaches the end of the loop without returning False, it means that all the numbers from 1 to n are not divisible by 3, and the number is the multiplication of 3 prime numbers.

This code assumes that the input number n is a positive integer. If the input is not a positive integer, the function will raise a ValueError. To handle this case, you can add a check before the for loop to ensure that n is a positive integer.

```
def is_multiple_of_3_prime_numbers(n):
    if not isinstance(n, int) or n < 1:
        raise ValueError("n must be a positive integer")
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        if i % 3 == 0:
            return False
    return True
```
This code adds a check before the for loop to ensure that n is a positive integer. If the input is not a positive integer, the function will raise a ValueError.</s>  To solve this problem, we can use the Euclidean algorithm to find the prime factors of the number. The Euclidean algorithm is a method for computing the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers, but it can also be used to find the prime factors of a number.

Here's the code:
```
def is_multiple_of_3_prime_numbers(n):
    if n == 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```
This code uses the Euclidean algorithm to find the prime factors of the number `n`. It starts by checking if `n` is equal to 1, because if it is, then it is not the product of three prime numbers. If `n` is not equal to 1, then it checks if `n` is divisible by any prime factors between 2 and the square root of `n`. If it is divisible by a prime factor, then it is not the product of three prime numbers. If it is not divisible by any prime factors, then it is the product of three prime numbers.

To test the code, you can use the following test cases:
```
print(is_multiple_of_3_prime_numbers(1))  # should print False
print(is_multiple_of_3_prime_numbers(2))  # should print False
print(is_multiple_of_3_prime_numbers(3))  # should print True
print(is_multiple_of_3_prime_numbers(4))  # should print False
print(is_multiple_of_3_prime_numbers(5))  # should print True
print(is_multiple_of_3_prime_numbers(6))  # should print False
print(is_multiple_of_3_prime_numbers(7))  # should print True
print(is_multiple_of_3_prime_numbers(8))  # should print False
print(is_multiple_of_3_prime_numbers(9))  # should print False
print(is_multiple_of_3_prime_numbers(10))  # should print False
```
This code should produce the following output:
```
False
False
True
False
True
False
True
False
False
False
False
```</s>  To check if a given number is the multiplication of 3 prime numbers, we can use the following Python code:
```
def is_multiple_of_3_primes(n):
    # Check if n is divisible by 3
    if n % 3 != 0:
        return False

    # Check if the number is a prime number
    if is_prime(n):
        return True

    # Check if the number is a multiple of 3 prime numbers
    for i in range(1, n):
        if is_prime(i) and is_prime(n // i) and is_prime(n // (i * (n // i))):
            return True

    return False

def is_prime(n):
    if n == 1 or n == 0:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```
This code first checks if the number is divisible by 3. If it is not, it immediately returns False. If it is, it checks if the number is a prime number using the is_prime function. If it is a prime number, it returns True. If it is not a prime number, it checks if the number is a multiple of 3 prime numbers using the is_multiple_of_3_primes function. This function checks if the number can be expressed as the product of 3 prime numbers by iterating over all possible combinations of prime numbers. If a combination is found, the function returns True. If no combination is found, the function returns False.

Note that the is_prime function is a simple implementation of the Miller-Rabin primality test, which is a probabilistic algorithm for determining whether a number is prime. The is_multiple_of_3_primes function is a modified version of the Miller-Rabin primality test that is optimized for the case of a multiple of 3 prime numbers.</s>
