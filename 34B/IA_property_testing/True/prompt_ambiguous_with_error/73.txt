Prompt: Find the minimum number of elements that need to be swapped to make an array palindromic.
-------------------
  Here is a test suite using the Hypothesis library to test a future solution for the problem of finding the minimum number of elements that need to be swapped to make an array palindromic:
```
from hypothesis import given, strategies

def property_test(candidate_function):
    @given(strategies.lists(strategies.integers(), min_size=1), strategies.integers(min_value=1))
    def test_palindrome(arr, k):
        # Test that the candidate function returns the correct minimum number of swaps
        result = candidate_function(arr, k)
        assert result in range(len(arr))
        assert result == len(arr) - 1 or result == len(arr) - 2
        return result

    return [test_palindrome]
```
This test suite defines a single property test called `test_palindrome` that takes an array `arr` and an integer `k` as input. It checks that the candidate function returns the correct minimum number of swaps to make the array palindromic, and that the result is within the valid range of possible swaps.

The test suite uses the `strategies.lists` and `strategies.integers` strategies from the Hypothesis library to generate random arrays and integers for testing. The `min_size` parameter of `strategies.lists` is set to 1 to ensure that the generated arrays are non-empty. The `min_value` parameter of `strategies.integers` is set to 1 to ensure that the generated integers are positive.

To run the test suite, you can use the following code:
```
from hypothesis import given

candidate_function = ...  # Your solution to the problem

property_test(candidate_function)
```
This will run the `test_palindrome` property test with randomly generated inputs and check that the candidate function returns the correct minimum number of swaps.</s>  ```

        if arr[i] != arr[len(arr) - i - 1]:
            min_swaps += 1
        i += 1

    for i in range(n//2):
        if arr[i] != arr[n-i-1]:

    return count
```
Example:
```
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
print(get_swap_count(arr)) # Output: 3
```
Explanation:

The array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]` is not palindromic, so we need to swap elements to make it palindromic. We can swap the elements at indices 0 and 6, and the elements at indices 1 and 5, and the elements at indices 2 and 4. This results in the array `[7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`, which is palindromic. Therefore, the minimum number of swaps required to make the array palindromic is 3.</s>  ```
def find_min_swaps(arr):
    # Initialize variables to keep track of the minimum number of swaps and the current index
    min_swaps = 0
    curr_idx = 0

    # Loop through the array and compare the current element to the element at the opposite end
    for i in range(len(arr) // 2):
        # If the elements are not the same, increment the minimum number of swaps
        if arr[i] != arr[len(arr) - i - 1]:
            min_swaps += 1

    # Return the minimum number of swaps
    return min_swaps
```
This code uses a single loop to iterate through the array and compare each element to the element at the opposite end. If the elements are not the same, the minimum number of swaps is incremented. The loop continues until the middle of the array is reached, at which point the minimum number of swaps is returned.

Here is an example of how this code would work for the array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`:
```
>>> find_min_swaps([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])
2
```
In this example, the minimum number of swaps required to make the array palindromic is 2, since the elements at indices 0 and 5 are not the same.</s>  ```
def min_swaps_to_make_palindromic(arr):
    # Check if array is already palindromic
    if arr == arr[::-1]:
        return 0

    # Initialize variables
    n = len(arr)
    left = 0
    right = n - 1
    swaps = 0

    # Loop through the array from both ends
    while left < right:
        # If elements at left and right indices are not the same, swap them
        if arr[left] != arr[right]:
            arr[left], arr[right] = arr[right], arr[left]
            swaps += 1
        # Move left and right indices towards the middle
        left += 1
        right -= 1

    return swaps
```
This solution uses a two-pointer approach to find the minimum number of swaps required to make the array palindromic. It iterates through the array from both ends and compares the elements at the left and right indices. If the elements are not the same, it swaps them and increments the swap counter. It continues this process until the left index reaches the middle of the array. The final value of the swap counter is the minimum number of swaps required to make the array palindromic.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
print(min_swaps_to_make_palindromic(arr)) # Output: 3
```
This would swap the elements at indices 0 and 5, then the elements at indices 1 and 4, and finally the elements at indices 2 and 3, resulting in the palindromic array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`.</s>  ```
def min_swaps_to_make_palindromic(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    # Initialize a dictionary to keep track of the count of each element
    count = {}
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] not in count:
            count[arr[i]] = 0
        count[arr[i]] += 1

    # Initialize a variable to keep track of the minimum number of swaps
    min_swaps = 0

    # Iterate over the array and check if the element is present in the second half of the array
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] in count and count[arr[i]] > 0:
            # If the element is present in the second half of the array,
            # we need to swap it with the corresponding element in the first half
            j = n - 1 - i
            arr[i], arr[j] = arr[j], arr[i]
            min_swaps += 1
            count[arr[i]] -= 1

    return min_swaps
```
This code uses a dictionary to keep track of the count of each element in the array. It then iterates over the array and checks if the element is present in the second half of the array. If it is, it swaps it with the corresponding element in the first half and updates the count of the element. The minimum number of swaps required to make the array palindromic is the number of swaps performed.

Here is an example of how to use the function:
```
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
print(min_swaps_to_make_palindromic(arr)) # Output: 3
```
This would swap the elements at indices 1 and 4, and the elements at indices 2 and 5, to make the array palindromic.</s>

This test suite covers a variety of test cases, including palindromic and non-palindromic arrays, arrays with duplicates, and empty and single-element arrays. It also includes a test for the case where the array has an odd number of elements, which is a special case that needs to be handled correctly.

Note that this test suite assumes that the function to be tested takes a list of integers as input and returns the minimum number of swaps required to make the array palindromic. If the function takes a different input or returns a different output, the test suite will need to be modified accordingly.</s>  Sure, here is a test suite using the Hypothesis library to test a future solution for the problem of finding the minimum number of elements that need to be swapped to make an array palindromic:
```
from hypothesis import given, strategies

def property_test(candidate_function) -> None:
    @given(strategies.lists(strategies.integers()))
    def property_1(input_list):
        # Test that the output is a valid palindrome
        output = candidate_function(input_list)
        assert output == output[::-1]

        # Test that the number of swaps is minimized
        num_swaps = 0
        for i in range(len(input_list) // 2):
            if input_list[i] != input_list[-i-1]:
                num_swaps += 1
        assert num_swaps == len(output) - len(input_list)

        # Test that the swaps are actually performed
        assert all(input_list[i] == output[i] for i in range(len(input_list)))

    return [property_1]
```
This test suite defines a single property test, `property_1`, that checks that the output of the candidate function is a valid palindrome, that the number of swaps is minimized, and that the swaps are actually performed. The test suite is parameterized by a list of integers, and the input list is used to test the candidate function.

Note that this is just one possible approach to testing the problem, and there are many other ways to test the solution. The key is to identify the properties that you want to test and to write test cases that exercise those properties.</s>  ```
def get_min_swaps(arr):
    # Initialize variables to keep track of the minimum number of swaps
    # and the current index being considered for swapping
    min_swaps = 0
    current_index = 0

    # Loop through the array and check if the current index is not
    # equal to the corresponding index from the end of the array
    for i in range(len(arr) // 2):
        if arr[i] != arr[len(arr) - i - 1]:
            # If the indices are not equal, increment the minimum number of swaps
            min_swaps += 1

            # Swap the elements at the current index and the corresponding
            # index from the end of the array
            arr[i], arr[len(arr) - i - 1] = arr[len(arr) - i - 1], arr[i]

    # Return the minimum number of swaps needed to make the array palindromic
    return min_swaps
```
This code uses a simple algorithm to find the minimum number of swaps needed to make an array palindromic. It works by iterating through the array and checking if the element at the current index is not equal to the corresponding element from the end of the array. If the elements are not equal, it swaps them and increments the minimum number of swaps needed. The algorithm then continues to the next index and repeats the process until the entire array has been checked.

Here is an example of how the code would work for the input array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`:
```
# Initialize the array
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

# Get the minimum number of swaps needed to make the array palindromic
min_swaps = get_min_swaps(arr)

# Print the minimum number of swaps
print(min_swaps)  # Output: 3
```
This code would swap the elements at indices 0 and 8, then swap the elements at indices 1 and 7, and finally swap the elements at indices 2 and 6, resulting in the minimum number of swaps needed to make the array palindromic.</s>  ```
def min_swaps_palindrome(arr):
    # Check if the array is already a palindrome
    if arr == arr[::-1]:
        return 0

    # Initialize variables to keep track of the minimum number of swaps
    min_swaps = float("inf")
    current_swaps = 0

    # Loop through the array and compare the elements with the reverse of the array
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        if arr[i] != arr[len(arr) - 1 - i]:
            current_swaps += 1
        else:
            current_swaps = 0
        min_swaps = min(min_swaps, current_swaps)

    return min_swaps
```
This code uses a single loop to iterate through the array and compare each element with the corresponding element in the reverse of the array. If the elements are not the same, it increments the `current_swaps` variable. If the elements are the same, it resets the `current_swaps` variable to 0. At the end of the loop, it returns the minimum number of swaps required to make the array palindromic.

Here is an example usage of the function:
```
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
print(min_swaps_palindrome(arr)) # Output: 3
```
This code would return 3, which is the minimum number of swaps required to make the array palindromic.</s>  ```
def get_min_swaps(arr):
    # Initialize variables to keep track of the minimum number of swaps
    # and the current index of the array
    min_swaps = 0
    i = 0

    # Loop through the array and compare the current element with the
    # element at the opposite end of the array
    while i < len(arr) // 2:
        # If the elements are not equal, increment the minimum number of swaps
        if arr[i] != arr[len(arr) - i - 1]:
            min_swaps += 1
        i += 1

    return min_swaps
```

This function takes an array as input and returns the minimum number of swaps required to make the array palindromic. It does this by iterating through the array and comparing each element with the element at the opposite end of the array. If the elements are not equal, the function increments the minimum number of swaps. The function returns the minimum number of swaps required to make the array palindromic.

Here is an example of how this function would be used:
```
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

This function takes an array as input and returns the minimum number of swaps required to make the array palindromic. It does this by iterating through the array and comparing each element to its mirrored element. If the elements are not equal, it increments the swap count and swaps them. It then repeats this process until it reaches the middle of the array, at which point it returns the swap count.

Here is an example usage of the function:
```
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(min_swaps_to_make_palindrome(arr)) # Output: 2
```
In this example, the function would swap the 1 and 5, and then the 2 and 4, resulting in a palindromic array. The function would return 2, which is the minimum number of swaps required to make the array palindromic.</s>  ```

**********************

  Here is a test suite using the `hypothesis` library to test a future solution for the problem of finding the minimum number of elements that need to be swapped to make an array palindromic:
```
from hypothesis import given, strategies

@given(strategies.lists(strategies.integers(), min_size=1))
def test_min_swaps_palindrome(candidate_function, test_input):
    # Test that the candidate function returns a valid result
    result = candidate_function(test_input)
    assert result >= 0 and result <= len(test_input) - 1

    # Test that the candidate function returns the correct result
    expected_result = len(test_input) // 2
    assert result == expected_result

    # Test that the candidate function returns the correct result for a palindrome
    palindrome = test_input[::-1]
    result = candidate_function(palindrome)
    assert result == 0

    # Test that the candidate function returns the correct result for a non-palindrome
    non_palindrome = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
    result = candidate_function(non_palindrome)
    assert result == 5

    # Test that the candidate function returns the correct result for a large input
    large_input = [i for i in range(10000)]
    result = candidate_function(large_input)
    assert result == 5000
```
This test suite uses the `@given` decorator from the `hypothesis` library to generate random test inputs of varying sizes. The `test_min_swaps_palindrome` function takes a candidate solution function as input and tests it against a variety of test cases, including a palindrome, a non-palindrome, and a large input. The function asserts that the candidate function returns the correct result for each test case.

Note that this is just one possible test suite for this problem, and you may need to adjust or modify it depending on your specific requirements and constraints.</s>  Sure, here is a test suite for the `min_swaps_palindrome` function:
```
from hypothesis import given, strategies

def min_swaps_palindrome(arr):
    """
    Given an array of integers, find the minimum number of elements that need
    to be swapped to make the array palindromic.
    """
    # TODO: implement this function
    return 0

@given(strategies.lists(strategies.integers()))
def test_min_swaps_palindrome(arr):
    result = min_swaps_palindrome(arr)
    assert result >= 0
    assert result <= len(arr) // 2
    # Check that the array is palindromic after swapping
    swapped_arr = arr.copy()
    for i in range(result):
        swapped_arr[i], swapped_arr[-i-1] = swapped_arr[-i-1], swapped_arr[i]
    assert swapped_arr == arr[::-1]
```
This test suite uses the `hypothesis` library to generate random test cases. It generates a list of integers and passes it to the `min_swaps_palindrome` function. The test suite then checks that the result is non-negative and less than or equal to half the length of the array. It also checks that the array is palindromic after swapping the first and last elements `result` times.

Note that this is just a basic test suite, and you may want to add more tests depending on your specific requirements.</s>  Sure, here's a test suite using the `hypothesis` library to test a future solution for the "minimum number of elements that need to be swapped to make an array palindromic" problem:
```
from hypothesis import given, strategies

@given(strategies.lists(strategies.integers()))
def test_min_swaps_to_make_palindromic(arr):
    # Test that the solution returns the correct number of swaps
    # for a random input array
    result = property_test(arr)
    assert result == len(arr) - len(set(arr))

@given(strategies.lists(strategies.integers()))
def test_swaps_are_valid(arr):
    # Test that the solution only swaps adjacent elements
    result = property_test(arr)
    for i in range(len(arr) - 1):
        assert arr[i] == arr[i + 1] or arr[i] == arr[i - 1]

@given(strategies.lists(strategies.integers()))
def test_palindrome_property(arr):
    # Test that the solution produces a palindromic array
    result = property_test(arr)
    assert arr == arr[::-1]
```
This test suite includes three test cases:

1. `test_min_swaps_to_make_palindromic`: This test case checks that the solution returns the correct number of swaps for a random input array.
2. `test_swaps_are_valid`: This test case checks that the solution only swaps adjacent elements.
3. `test_palindrome_property`: This test case checks that the solution produces a palindromic array.

The `hypothesis` library is used to generate random input arrays for each test case. The `strategies.lists(strategies.integers())` strategy is used to generate lists of integers, which are used as input for the solution. The `strategies.integers()` strategy is used to generate integers, which are used to generate the random input arrays.

The `test_min_swaps_to_make_palindromic` test case uses the `property_test` function to check that the solution returns the correct number of swaps for a random input array. The `test_swaps_are_valid` test case uses the `property_test` function to check that the solution only swaps adjacent elements. The `test_palindrome_property` test case uses the `property_test` function to check that the solution produces a palindromic array.

These test cases cover the basic requirements for the solution, and can be used to ensure that the solution is correct and efficient.</s>  Sure, here is a test suite for a hypothetical solution to the problem of finding the minimum number of elements that need to be swapped to make an array palindromic:
```
from hypothesis import given, strategies

def property_test(candidate_function) -> None:
    @given(strategies.lists(strategies.integers(), min_size=1))
    def property_1(arr):
        # Test that the function returns a valid index
        assert 0 <= candidate_function(arr) < len(arr)

        # Test that the function returns the correct index
        if len(arr) % 2 == 0:
            assert candidate_function(arr) == len(arr) // 2
        else:
            assert candidate_function(arr) == len(arr) // 2 - 1

        # Test that the function returns the correct number of swaps
        swaps = 0
        for i in range(len(arr) // 2):
            if arr[i] != arr[len(arr) - 1 - i]:
                swaps += 1
        assert candidate_function(arr) == swaps

    @given(strategies.lists(strategies.integers(), min_size=1))
    def property_2(arr):
        # Test that the function returns the correct number of swaps
        # for a specific input
        assert candidate_function(arr) == 3

    return [property_1, property_2]
```
This test suite contains two property tests:

* `property_1` tests that the function returns a valid index and the correct number of swaps for a randomly generated input array.
* `property_2` tests that the function returns the correct number of swaps for a specific input array.

Both tests use the `hypothesis` library to generate random input arrays. The `property_1` test uses the `strategies.lists` strategy to generate arrays of integers, and the `property_2` test uses the `strategies.integers` strategy to generate a specific input array.

Note that this is just one possible test suite for this problem, and you may need to add additional tests depending on the specific requirements of your solution.</s>  ```
def min_swaps_to_make_palindromic(arr):
    # Initialize variables to keep track of the minimum number of swaps and the current palindrome length
    min_swaps = 0
    current_palindrome_length = 0

    # Loop through the array and check if each element is the same as the element at the corresponding index from the end
    for i in range(len(arr) // 2):
        if arr[i] == arr[len(arr) - i - 1]:
            # If the elements are the same, increment the current palindrome length
            current_palindrome_length += 1
        else:
            # If the elements are not the same, add the difference between the indices to the minimum number of swaps
            min_swaps += abs(i - (len(arr) - i - 1))

    # Return the minimum number of swaps needed to make the array palindromic
    return min_swaps
```
This solution works by iterating through the array and checking if each element is the same as the element at the corresponding index from the end. If the elements are the same, the current palindrome length is incremented. If the elements are not the same, the difference between the indices is added to the minimum number of swaps. The minimum number of swaps needed to make the array palindromic is returned.

Here is an example of how this function would work:
```
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
print(min_swaps_to_make_palindromic(arr)) # Output: 4
```
In this example, the function would return 4, which is the minimum number of swaps needed to make the array palindromic. The swaps would be as follows:
```
1. Swap indices 0 and 8: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] -> [9, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 1]
2. Swap indices 1 and 7: [9, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 1] -> [9, 8, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 2, 1]
3. Swap indices 2 and 6: [9, 8, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 2, 1] -> [9, 8, 7, 4, 5, 6, 3, 2, 1]
4. Swap indices 3 and 5: [9, 8, 7, 4, 5, 6, 3, 2, 1] -> [9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
```
This solution has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(1), where n is the length of the array.</s>  ```

    count = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] != arr[mid]:
            count += 1

    # if the count is odd, we need to swap the middle element with one of the elements

    if count % 2 == 1:
        for i in range(n):

        # Increment the current index
        curr_idx += 1

    # If the loop completes and the array is not palindromic, return -1
    return -1
```

This solution uses a single loop to iterate through the array and compare each element to the element at the opposite end of the array. If the elements are not equal, the minimum number of swaps is incremented. If the current index is equal to the length of the array divided by 2, the array is palindromic, so the minimum number of swaps is returned. If the loop completes and the array is not palindromic, -1 is returned.

Here is an example of how this function would be called:
```
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(min_swaps_to_make_palindromic(arr))  # Output: 3
```
This would output 3, which is the minimum number of swaps required to make the array palindromic.</s>  ```
def min_swaps_to_make_palindrome(arr):
    # Initialize variables to keep track of the minimum number of swaps and the current palindrome status
    min_swaps = 0
    is_palindrome = False

    # Loop through the array and check if it is a palindrome
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        # Check if the array is a palindrome
        is_palindrome = arr == arr[::-1]
        if is_palindrome:
            break

        # If the array is not a palindrome, swap the first and last elements
        arr[0], arr[-1] = arr[-1], arr[0]
        min_swaps += 1

    return min_swaps
```
This code uses a simple approach to solve the problem. It iterates through the array and checks if it is a palindrome. If it is not, it swaps the first and last elements and increments the minimum number of swaps. It continues this process until the array becomes a palindrome.

Here is an example of how the code works:
```
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
min_swaps = min_swaps_to_make_palindrome(arr)
print(min_swaps) # Output: 3
```
In this example, the array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` is not a palindrome, so the code swaps the first and last elements (`1` and `5`) to get `[5, 2, 3, 4, 1]`. This process is repeated twice more to get `[4, 2, 3, 1, 5]` and `[3, 2, 1, 4, 5]`, which are both palindromes. Therefore, the minimum number of swaps required to make the array palindromic is 3.</s>  ```
def min_swaps_to_make_palindrome(arr):
    # Initialize variables to keep track of the minimum number of swaps
    # and the current index in the array
    min_swaps = 0
    i = 0

    # Loop through the array until the middle element is reached
    while i < len(arr) // 2:
        # If the elements at the current index and its mirrored index
        # are not equal, increment the minimum number of swaps
        if arr[i] != arr[len(arr) - i - 1]:
            min_swaps += 1
        # Increment the current index
        i += 1

    # Return the minimum number of swaps
    return min_swaps
```
This code uses a single loop to iterate through the array until the middle element is reached. At each iteration, it checks if the elements at the current index and its mirrored index are not equal, and if so, it increments the minimum number of swaps. The loop continues until the middle element is reached, at which point the minimum number of swaps is returned.

Here's an example of how this code would work for the input array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`:

1. The loop starts at the beginning of the array and checks if `arr[0] != arr[6]`. Since `1 != 7`, the minimum number of swaps is incremented to 1.
2. The loop continues to the next iteration and checks if `arr[1] != arr[5]`. Since `2 != 6`, the minimum number of swaps is incremented to 2.
3. The loop continues to the next iteration and checks if `arr[2] != arr[4]`. Since `3 != 5`, the minimum number of swaps is incremented to 3.
4. The loop continues to the next iteration and checks if `arr[3] != arr[3]`. Since `4 == 4`, the minimum number of swaps is not incremented.
5. The loop continues to the next iteration and checks if `arr[4] != arr[2]`. Since `5 != 3`, the minimum number of swaps is incremented to 4.
6. The loop continues to the next iteration and checks if `arr[5] != arr[1]`. Since `6 != 2`, the minimum number of swaps is incremented to 5.
7. The loop continues to the next iteration and checks if `arr[6] != arr[0]`. Since `7 != 1`, the minimum number of swaps is incremented to 6.

Since the minimum number of swaps required to make the array palindromic is 6, this is the value that is returned by the function.</s>  ```
def get_min_swaps(arr):
    # Initialize variables to keep track of the minimum number of swaps
    # and the current position in the array
    min_swaps = 0
    pos = 0

This function takes an array as input and returns the minimum number of swaps required to make the array palindromic. It does this by iterating through the array until the middle element is reached, and keeping track of the minimum number of swaps required to make the array palindromic. If the element at the current index is not equal to the element at the index from the end of the array, the function increments the minimum number of swaps. Once the middle element is reached, the function returns the minimum number of swaps required.

Here is an example usage of this function:
```
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(min_swaps(arr)) # Output: 2
```
In this example, the minimum number of swaps required to make the array palindromic is 2, which is the number of swaps required to swap the elements at indices 0 and 4.</s>  ```

This code uses a single loop to iterate through the array and compare each element with its opposite element. If the elements are not equal, the minimum number of swaps is incremented. The loop continues until the current index is greater than the length of the array divided by 2, at which point it is known that the array is not palindromic and there is no need to continue looping.

The time complexity of this code is O(n), where n is the length of the array, since the loop iterates through the array only once. The space complexity is O(1) since no additional memory is used.

Here is an example of how this code would work for the input [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]:

1. The first element (1) is compared with the last element (5), which are not equal. The minimum number of swaps is incremented to 1.
2. The second element (2) is compared with the second-to-last element (4), which are not equal. The minimum number of swaps is incremented to 2.
3. The third element (3) is compared with the third-to-last element (3), which are equal. The minimum number of swaps is not incremented.
4. The fourth element (4) is compared with the fourth-to-last element (2), which are not equal. The minimum number of swaps is incremented to 3.
5. The fifth element (5) is compared with the fifth-to-last element (1), which are not equal. The minimum number of swaps is incremented to 4.

Therefore, the minimum number of swaps needed to make the array palindromic is 4.</s>
