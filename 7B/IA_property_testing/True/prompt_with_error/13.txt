Prompt: Return a lowest common multiple of two integers a and b
-------------------
  Here is a test suite to test a future solution to the problem of finding the lowest common multiple of two integers a and b:
```
from hypothesis import given, strategies

def property_test(candidate_function):
    @given(strategies.integers(min_value=0))
    def property_1(a):
        result = candidate_function(a, a)
        assert result == a

    @given(strategies.integers(min_value=0))
    def property_2(a, b):
        result = candidate_function(a, b)
        assert result == a * b

    @given(strategies.integers(min_value=0), strategies.integers(min_value=0))
    def property_3(a, b):
        result = candidate_function(a, b)
        assert result == a * b

    return [property_1, property_2, property_3]
```
This test suite uses the Hypothesis library to generate random integers and test the candidate function against the properties of the lowest common multiple.

The first property test, `property_1`, checks that the candidate function returns the correct result when both `a` and `b` are equal to the result.

The second property test, `property_2`, checks that the candidate function returns the correct result when `a` and `b` are equal to each other.

The third property test, `property_3`, checks that the candidate function returns the correct result when `a` and `b` are not equal to each other.

Note that this is just an example test suite, and you may need to modify it to fit the specific requirements of your solution.</s>  To find the lowest common multiple (LCM) of two integers a and b, we can use the following formula:

LCM(a, b) = a \* b / gcd(a, b)

where gcd(a, b) is the greatest common divisor of a and b.

Here's an example of how to implement this formula in Python:
```
def lcm(a, b):
    return a * b // gcd(a, b)
```
This function takes two integers as input, a and b, and returns their LCM.

To test this function, you can use the following code:
```
print(lcm(2, 3)) # should print 6
print(lcm(4, 6)) # should print 12
print(lcm(8, 10)) # should print 40
```
This code should print 6, 12, and 40, respectively.</s>  ```
def lcm(a, b):
    if a > b:
        greater = a
    else:
        greater = b

    while True:
        if (greater % a == 0) and (greater % b == 0):
            lcm = greater
            break
        greater += 1

    return lcm
```</s>  ```
def lcm(a, b):
    if a > b:
        greater = a
    else:
        greater = b
        
    while True:
        if (greater % a == 0) and (greater % b == 0):
            lcm = greater
            break
        greater += 1
            
    return lcm
```
This code uses a while loop to find the lowest common multiple of two integers a and b. It starts by finding the greater of the two numbers and then iterates until it finds a number that is divisible by both a and b. The number found is the lowest common multiple.</s>  ```
def lcm(a, b):
    if a > b:
        greater = a
    else:
        greater = b

    while True:
        if (greater % a == 0) and (greater % b == 0):
            lcm = greater
            break
        greater += 1

    return lcm
```
This code uses a loop to find the least common multiple of two integers a and b. It starts by finding the greater of the two integers and then iterates through the numbers starting from the greater number until it finds a number that is a multiple of both a and b. The number found is then returned as the least common multiple.

For example, if a = 12 and b = 15, the least common multiple would be 60. If a = 10 and b = 12, the least common multiple would be 60.

This code uses the modulo operator (%) to check if a number is a multiple of both a and b. If the modulo of a number by a and b is 0, then the number is a multiple of both a and b. If the modulo is non-zero, then the number is not a multiple of both a and b.

This code also uses the greater than operator (>) to find the greater of two integers. If a is greater than b, then the loop will iterate through the numbers starting from a, and if b is greater than a, then the loop will iterate through the numbers starting from b.

Note that this code assumes that the inputs a and b are positive integers. If the inputs can be negative integers, then you will need to add additional code to handle the negative values.</s>  ```
def lcm(a, b):
    if a > b:
        greater = a
    else:
        greater = b

    while True:
        if (greater % a == 0) and (greater % b == 0):
            lcm = greater
            break
        greater += 1

    return lcm
```</s>  ```
def get_lcm(a, b):
    if a > b:
        greater = a
    else:
        greater = b
    while True:
        if (greater % a == 0) and (greater % b == 0):
            lcm = greater
            break
        greater += 1
    return lcm
```</s>  To find the lowest common multiple (LCM) of two integers a and b, we can use the following algorithm:
```
def lcm(a, b):
    if a > b:
        greater = a
    else:
        greater = b

    while True:
        if (greater % a == 0) and (greater % b == 0):
            return greater
        greater += 1
```
This algorithm starts by finding the greater of the two integers (a and b) and then repeatedly adds 1 to the greater value until it finds a multiple of both a and b.

For example, if a = 6 and b = 8, the LCM would be 24. If a = 12 and b = 15, the LCM would be 30.

This code works because the LCM is the smallest positive integer that is a multiple of both a and b. By repeatedly adding 1 to the greater value until we find a multiple of both a and b, we ensure that we are always looking at a number that is greater than or equal to the LCM.</s>  ```
def lcm(a, b):
    if a > b:
        greater = a
    else:
        greater = b

    while True:
        if (greater % a == 0) and (greater % b == 0):
            lcm = greater
            break
        greater += 1

    return lcm
```</s>  ```
def lcm(a, b):
    if a > b:
        greater = a
    else:
        greater = b

    while True:
        if (greater % a == 0) and (greater % b == 0):
            lcm = greater
            break
        greater += 1

    return lcm
```
This code uses the Euclidean algorithm to find the least common multiple of two integers a and b. It works by iteratively adding 1 to the greater of the two numbers until it finds a number that is divisible by both a and b. The loop breaks when the number found is the least common multiple of a and b.</s>  ```
def lcm(a, b):
    if a > b:
        greater = a
    else:
        greater = b

    while True:
        if (greater % a == 0) and (greater % b == 0):
            lcm = greater
            break
        greater += 1

    return lcm
