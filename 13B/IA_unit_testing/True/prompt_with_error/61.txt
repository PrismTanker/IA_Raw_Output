            count -= 1
        if count < 0:
            return False
    return count == 0
```
This code uses a variable `count` to keep track of the number of open brackets. It iterates through the string `brackets` and for each bracket, it adds 1 to the count if it's an open bracket and subtracts 1 if it's a close bracket. If the count becomes negative, it means there are more close brackets than open brackets, so it returns `False`. If the count is not 0 at the end of the loop, it means there are an uneven number of brackets, so it returns `False`. If the count is 0, it means there are an equal number of open and close brackets, so it returns `True`.</s>  ```

            if not stack:
                return False
            stack.pop()
    return not stack
```
This code uses a stack to keep track of the open brackets. Whenever it encounters an open bracket, it pushes it onto the stack. Whenever it encounters a close bracket, it pops an element from the stack and checks if it is an open bracket. If the stack is empty, it means that there are more close brackets than open brackets, and the function returns False. If the stack is not empty, it means that there are an equal number of open and close brackets, and the function returns True.</s>  ```
def is_balanced_brackets(brackets):
    stack = []
    for bracket in brackets:
        if bracket == "(":
            stack.append(bracket)
        else:
            if not stack:
                return False
            stack.pop()
    return not stack
```
This code uses a stack to keep track of the open brackets. It iterates through the brackets string, and for each open bracket, it adds it to the stack. For each close bracket, it pops an element from the stack. If the stack is empty at the end, it means that there is an equal number of open and close brackets, and the function returns `True`. If the stack is not empty at the end, it means that there is an unequal number of open and close brackets, and the function returns `False`.

Note that this code assumes that the brackets are well-formed, meaning that there is no mismatch between the number of open and close brackets. If you want to handle this case, you can modify the code as follows:
```
def is_balanced_brackets(brackets):
    stack = []
    for bracket in brackets:
        if bracket == "(":
            stack.append(bracket)
        else:
            if not stack:
                return False
            stack.pop()
    return len(stack) == 0
```
This code adds an extra check at the end to make sure that the stack is empty, even if the brackets are not well-formed. If the stack is not empty, it means that there is an unequal number of open and close brackets, and the function returns `False`.</s>  ```
def is_balanced(brackets):
    stack = []
    for bracket in brackets:
        if bracket == "(":
            stack.append(bracket)
        else:
            if len(stack) == 0:
                return False
            stack.pop()
    return len(stack) == 0
```</s>  ```
def is_balanced(brackets):
    stack = []
    for bracket in brackets:
        if bracket == "(":
            stack.append(bracket)
        elif bracket == ")":
            if len(stack) == 0:
                return False
            stack.pop()
    return len(stack) == 0
```
This code uses a stack to keep track of the open brackets. It iterates through each bracket in the string and appends a "(" to the stack when it sees an open bracket and pops a "(" from the stack when it sees a close bracket. If the stack is empty at the end, then the brackets are balanced.

Note that this code assumes that the input string only contains "(" and ")" characters, and that there are no other characters in the string. If you need to handle more complex inputs, you may need to modify the code accordingly.</s>  ```
def is_balanced(brackets):
    stack = []
    for char in brackets:
        if char == "(":
            stack.append(char)
        elif char == ")":
            if not stack:
                return False
            stack.pop()
    return not stack
```
This function uses a stack to keep track of the open brackets. It iterates through the brackets string and for each open bracket it adds it to the stack. When it encounters a close bracket, it checks if there is an open bracket on the stack. If there is, it removes it from the stack. If there isn't, it returns False. After iterating through the entire string, if the stack is empty, it returns True.</s>  ```
def check_balanced_brackets(brackets):
    open_brackets = 0
    close_brackets = 0
    for bracket in brackets:
        if bracket == '(':
            open_brackets += 1
        else:
            close_brackets += 1
    return open_brackets == close_brackets
```
This function takes a string of brackets as input and returns True if the number of open and close brackets is equal, and False otherwise. It works by iterating over each bracket in the string and keeping track of the number of open and close brackets. If the numbers of open and close brackets are equal at the end of the iteration, the function returns True, otherwise it returns False.

Here is an example usage of the function:
```
print(check_balanced_brackets("()")) # should return True
print(check_balanced_brackets("(()")) # should return False
print(check_balanced_brackets("()()")) # should return True
print(check_balanced_brackets("((())")) # should return False
```</s>  ```
def is_balanced(brackets):
    stack = []
    for bracket in brackets:
        if bracket == "(":
            stack.append(bracket)
        else:
            if len(stack) == 0:
                return False
            stack.pop()
    return len(stack) == 0
```
This function uses a stack to keep track of the open brackets. It iterates through the string of brackets and for each "(" it pushes the bracket onto the stack, and for each ")" it pops the top bracket from the stack. If the stack is empty at the end, then there are an equal number of open and close brackets. If the stack is not empty, then there are more open brackets than close brackets.</s>  ```
def is_balanced_brackets(brackets):
    return len([b for b in brackets if b == "("]) == len([b for b in brackets if b == ")"])
```
This function uses a list comprehension to count the number of open brackets and the number of close brackets. It then checks if these two counts are equal, returning `True` if they are and `False` otherwise.

For example:
```
print(is_balanced_brackets("()")) # True
print(is_balanced_brackets("(()")) # False
print(is_balanced_brackets("()()")) # True
print(is_balanced_brackets("((()")) # False
```</s>  ```
def check_brackets(brackets):
    return brackets.count("(") == brackets.count(")")
```
This code uses the `count()` method to count the number of open and close brackets in the `brackets` string. If the number of open brackets is equal to the number of close brackets, the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```
print(check_brackets("()"))  # Output: True
print(check_brackets("(()"))  # Output: False
print(check_brackets("()()"))  # Output: True
