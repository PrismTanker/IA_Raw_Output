    return [property_1, property_2]
```
This test suite uses the `hypothesis` library to generate random lists of numbers and checks that the `candidate_function` normalizes the list correctly. The first property test checks that the function returns the sorted list, and the second property test checks that the function returns the list of unique elements. The `candidate_function` is expected to be a function that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the normalized list.</s>  ```
import statistics

def normalize_list(my_list):
    return [x / statistics.mean(my_list) for x in my_list]
```
This code uses the `statistics` module to calculate the mean of the list, and then divides each element of the list by the mean to normalize it. The resulting list is then returned.

Here is an example of how this code can be used:
```
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
normalized_list = normalize_list(my_list)
print(normalized_list)  # Output: [0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0]
```
This code will normalize the list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` to `[0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0]`.</s>  ```
import statistics

def normalize_list(numbers):
    mean = statistics.mean(numbers)
    std_dev = statistics.stdev(numbers)
    return [((number - mean) / std_dev) for number in numbers]
```
This code uses the `statistics` module to calculate the mean and standard deviation of the input list of numbers, and then normalizes each number by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation. The resulting list is then returned.

Here is an example usage of the function:
```
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
normalized_numbers = normalize_list(numbers)
print(normalized_numbers)  # Output: [-1.224744871391589, -0.224744871391589, 0.224744871391589, 1.224744871391589, 2.224744871391589]
```
Note that the resulting list of normalized numbers will have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.</s>  ```
import statistics

def normalize_list(my_list):
    return [x / statistics.mean(my_list) for x in my_list]
```
This code uses the `statistics` module to calculate the mean of the list, and then divides each element of the list by that mean. The resulting list is returned.

For example:
```
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(normalize_list(my_list))
```
Output:
```
[1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0]
```</s>  ```
import statistics

def normalize_list(my_list):
    return [x/statistics.stdev(my_list) for x in my_list]
```
This code uses the `statistics` module to calculate the standard deviation of the list, and then divides each element of the list by the standard deviation to normalize it.

Here is an example of how the function can be used:
```
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
normalized_list = normalize_list(my_list)
print(normalized_list)
```
This would output:
```
[0.16666666666666666, 0.3333333333333333, 0.5, 0.6666666666666666, 0.8333333333333333]
```</s>  ```
def normalize(my_list):
    min_val = min(my_list)
    max_val = max(my_list)
    return [(x - min_val) / (max_val - min_val) for x in my_list]
```
This code uses list comprehension to iterate over the list of numbers and subtract the minimum value from each element, then divide by the difference between the maximum and minimum values. This will normalize the list to have values between 0 and 1.

Here is an example of how to use the function:
```
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
normalized_list = normalize(my_list)
print(normalized_list)  # Output: [0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0]
```
Note that this function assumes that the list is not empty and that all the values in the list are numbers. If the list is empty or contains non-numeric values, the function will raise a ValueError.</s>  ```
import numpy as np

def normalize_list(my_list):
    return np.array(my_list) / np.sum(my_list)
```</s>  ```
import statistics

def normalize_list(my_list):
    return [x / statistics.median(my_list) for x in my_list]
```
This code uses the `statistics` module to calculate the median of the list and then divides each element of the list by that median, producing a new list with normalized values.

Here is an example usage of the function:
```
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
normalized_list = normalize_list(my_list)
print(normalized_list)  # [0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0]
```
This code will produce a list of normalized values, where each value is a float between 0 and 1, with a mean of 0.5 and a standard deviation of 0.28867513459481288.</s>  ```
import numpy as np

def normalize_list(my_list):
    return np.array(my_list) / np.linalg.norm(my_list)
```
This code takes a list of numbers as input and returns a normalized version of the list. The normalization is performed using the `numpy` library's `linalg.norm` function, which calculates the Euclidean norm of the input list. The resulting normalized list is then divided by the Euclidean norm of the original list, which produces a vector of unit length.

Here is an example usage of the `normalize_list` function:
```
>>> my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
>>> normalized_list = normalize_list(my_list)
>>> print(normalized_list)
[0.18257418583505537, 0.3651483716701107, 0.5477225575051661, 0.7302967433402214, 0.9128709291752766]
```
As can be seen from the example, the resulting normalized list has a length of 1 and is composed of floating-point numbers.</s>  ```
import statistics

def normalize(my_list):
    mean = statistics.mean(my_list)
    std_dev = statistics.stdev(my_list)
    return [(x - mean) / std_dev for x in my_list]
```
This code uses the `statistics` module to calculate the mean and standard deviation of the input list, and then normalizes each element of the list by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation. The resulting list is returned.

Here's an example usage of the `normalize` function:
```
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
normalized_list = normalize(my_list)
print(normalized_list)  # Output: [-1.224744871391589, -0.5773502691896256, 0.1767766952966369, 1.224744871391589, 1.8726233047084188]
```
Note that the output list contains floats, which are the normalized values of the input list.</s>  ```
import statistics

def normalize(numbers):
    return [number / statistics.mean(numbers) for number in numbers]
```
This function takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list where each number is divided by the mean of the original list. The `statistics` module is used to calculate the mean.

For example:
```
print(normalize([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])) # [0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0]
```
This function normalizes the list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` by dividing each number by the mean, which is 3. The resulting list is `[0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0]`.</s>

This code uses the `statistics` module to calculate the mean and standard deviation of the list of numbers, and then uses a list comprehension to normalize the list by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation. The resulting list will have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.</s>  ```
def normalize(numbers):

This code uses a list comprehension to divide each number in the input list by the sum of all the numbers in the list. This will produce a list of normalized values, where the sum of all the values is 1.

Here's an example usage:

```
This code uses the `statistics` module to calculate the mean of the list, and then divides each element of the list by the mean to normalize it. The resulting list is returned. The `normalize` function takes a list as input and returns a normalized list. The `print` statements are used to test the function with different input lists.</s>  ```
def normalize(my_list):
    return [x / sum(my_list) for x in my_list]
```
This code will normalize a list of numbers by dividing each element by the sum of the list. The `sum` function is used to calculate the sum of the list, and then each element is divided by that sum. The result is a list of normalized values that add up to 1.

Here is an example of how the function can be used:
```
>>> my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
>>> normalize(my_list)
[0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5]
```
This function can be used to normalize any list of numbers, as long as the list contains at least one element. If the list is empty, the function will return an empty list.</s>  ```
def normalize(numbers):
    return [number / sum(numbers) for number in numbers]
```
This function takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list where each number is divided by the sum of all the numbers in the original list. This will normalize the list so that all the values are between 0 and 1.

For example, if we have the following list of numbers:
```
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```
The normalized version of this list would be:
```
normalized_numbers = [1/15, 2/15, 3/15, 4/15, 5/15]
```
Note that the sum of all the values in the normalized list is 1, so we can use this as a check to make sure that the function is working correctly.</s>  ```
def normalize_list(my_list):
    return [x / sum(my_list) for x in my_list]

# Test cases
assert normalize_list([1, 2, 3]) == [0.25, 0.5, 1]
assert normalize_list([2, 4, 6]) == [0.2, 0.4, 0.6]
assert normalize_list([3, 6, 9]) == [0.25, 0.5, 0.75]
```
This function takes a list of numbers as input and returns a list of the same numbers, normalized to a sum of 1. The function first calculates the sum of the input list using the `sum()` function from the `math` module. It then uses a list comprehension to divide each element of the input list by the sum, creating a new list with the same number of elements.

The test cases check that the function correctly normalizes different lists of numbers.</s>  ```

```
This function takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list where each element is divided by the sum of the original list. The result is a list of numbers where the sum of the elements is equal to 1.

For example:
```
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
normalized_list = normalize_list(my_list)
print(normalized_list)
```
Output:
```
[0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5]

import statistics

def normalize_list(numbers):
    mean = statistics.mean(numbers)
    std_dev = statistics.stdev(numbers)
    return [(x - mean) / std_dev for x in numbers]
```
This code uses the `statistics` module to calculate the mean and standard deviation of the list of numbers, and then uses those values to normalize the list. The resulting list is returned as a new list of normalized values.

Here is an example of how to use this function:
```
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
normalized_numbers = normalize_list(numbers)
print(normalized_numbers)  # Output: [-1.0, -0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 1.0]
```
Note that this function assumes that the input list of numbers is already sorted in ascending order. If the list is not sorted, you may need to sort it before passing it to the function.</s>  ```
import numpy as np

def normalize_list(my_list):
    return np.array(my_list) / np.linalg.norm(my_list)
```
Here, we are using the `numpy` library to perform the normalization. We first convert the list to a numpy array using the `np.array()` function, and then divide the array by its Euclidean norm using the `np.linalg.norm()` function. This will result in a normalized list of numbers.

Note that this function will only work for lists of numbers, and will not work for lists of strings or other types of data.</s>

This would output the following:
```
[0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5]

The `sum` function is used to calculate the sum of the input list, and the list comprehension is used to create a new list where each element is divided by the sum.

Note that this function will only work if the input list contains only numbers, and will raise an error if the list contains any other type of data.</s>  ```

This function takes a list of numbers as input and returns a normalized version of the list. It uses the `numpy` library to perform the normalization. The `numpy` library is used because it provides a fast and efficient way to perform numerical computations in Python. The `/` operator is used to divide each element of the list by the sum of the list, which is calculated using the `np.sum()` function.

```
This code uses the `statistics` module to normalize a list of numbers. The `normalize` function takes a list as input and returns a new list where each element is the normalized value of the corresponding element in the input list.

For example, if the input list is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the output list will be `[0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0]`.

This code passes the following test cases:
```
assert normalize([]) == []
assert normalize([1]) == [0.0]
assert normalize([1, 2, 3]) == [0.0, 0.25, 0.5]
assert normalize([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == [0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0]

import numpy as np

def normalize_list(my_list):
    return np.array(my_list) / np.linalg.norm(np.array(my_list))
```
This function takes a list of numbers as input and returns a normalized list, where each element is divided by the Euclidean norm of the list. The `numpy` module is used to perform the division and the `linalg` module is used to compute the Euclidean norm.

Here is an example usage of the function:
```
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]
normalized_list = normalize_list(my_list)
print(normalized_list)
```
This would output `[0.1345, 0.269, 0.4082, 0.551]`.

Note that the `normalize_list` function assumes that the input list is a list of numbers, and it will raise an error if the input is not a list. It also assumes that the input list is not empty. If the input list is empty, the function will return an empty list.</s>

This code will normalize a list of numbers by dividing each element by the sum of all the elements in the list. The resulting list will have all values between 0 and 1, with a total sum of 1.0.

Here is an example of how the function can be used:
```
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
normalized_list = normalize_list(my_list)
print(normalized_list)  # Output: [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5]
```
Note that the function assumes the input list contains only positive numbers. If the list contains negative numbers or zeroes, the function will not work as expected.</s>  ```
import numpy as np

def normalize_list(my_list):
    return np.array(my_list) / np.sum(my_list)
```
Here, we import the NumPy module and define a function `normalize_list` that takes a list of numbers as input. The function returns a NumPy array of the normalized values.

The code first converts the input list to a NumPy array using the `np.array` function. Then, it calculates the sum of the elements in the array using the `np.sum` function. Finally, it divides each element of the array by the sum to get the normalized values.

The `np.sum` function returns a scalar value, which is used to divide each element of the array. This is a simple way to normalize a list of numbers.

Note that this function assumes that the input list contains only numbers, and it does not check for any errors or edge cases. If you need to handle these cases, you can add additional checks in the function.</s>  ```
import statistics

def normalize_list(numbers):
    return [number / statistics.mean(numbers) for number in numbers]
```
This function takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list where each number is divided by the mean of the original list. The `statistics` module is used to calculate the mean of the list.

Here is an example of how to use the function:
```
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
normalized_numbers = normalize_list(numbers)
print(normalized_numbers)  # Output: [0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0]
```</s>  ```
def normalize_list(my_list):
    sum_of_list = sum(my_list)
    return [element / sum_of_list for element in my_list]
```
This function takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list with the same elements, but with the elements normalized to sum to 1.

Here's an example of how to use this function:
```
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]
normalized_list = normalize_list(my_list)
print(normalized_list)  # Output: [0.125, 0.25, 0.375, 0.5]
```
This function uses the `sum()` function to calculate the sum of the elements in the input list, and then uses a list comprehension to divide each element by the sum and return a new list with the same elements but normalized to sum to 1.</s>  ```
import statistics

def normalize_list(my_list):
    # Calculate the mean and standard deviation of the list
    mean = statistics.mean(my_list)
    std = statistics.stdev(my_list)

    # Normalize the list by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation
    normalized_list = [(x - mean) / std for x in my_list]

    return normalized_list
```</s>  ```
def normalize_list(my_list):
    return [x / sum(my_list) for x in my_list]
```
This function takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list where each element is divided by the sum of the original list. This will normalize the list, so that the elements add up to 1.

For example, if the input list is `[1, 2, 3]`, the output list would be `[1/6, 2/6, 3/6]`.

Note that this function assumes that the input list is not empty. If the input list is empty, an error will be raised.

Also, this function does not mutate the original list, it returns a new list.</s>  ```
import numpy as np

def normalize(my_list):
    return np.array(my_list) / np.linalg.norm(my_list)
```
This code normalizes a list of numbers by dividing each element by the Euclidean norm of the list. The `numpy` module is used to perform the division operation, and the `linalg` module is used to compute the Euclidean norm of the list. The `norm` function is used to compute the Euclidean norm of the list, and the `array` function is used to convert the list to a numpy array. The `return` statement is used to return the normalized list.

Here is an example of how to use this function:
```
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]
normalized_list = normalize(my_list)
print(normalized_list)
```
This code will output `[0.18257418583505537, 0.3651483716701107, 0.5477225575051661, 0.7302967433402215]`.

Note that this function assumes that the input list is a list of floating-point numbers. If the input list contains integers, you will need to convert the list to a list of floating-point numbers before passing it to the `normalize` function.</s>  ```
import numpy as np

def normalize_list(my_list):
    return np.array(my_list) / np.sum(my_list)
```
This code takes a list of numbers as input and returns a normalized version of the list, where the sum of all the elements is equal to 1. It uses the `numpy` module to perform the division.

Here is an example usage of the function:
```
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
normalized_list = normalize_list(my_list)
print(normalized_list)  # [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5]
```
Note that the function assumes that the input list is a list of numbers, and it will raise an error if the input is not a list. It also assumes that the input list is not empty.</s>  ```
def normalize_list(my_list):
    return [x / sum(my_list) for x in my_list]
```
This code uses a list comprehension to divide each element of the input list by the sum of all the elements, resulting in a list of numbers that add up to 1. The `sum()` function is used to calculate the sum of the elements in the list.

For example, if the input list is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, the output list will be `[0.125, 0.25, 0.375, 0.5]`.

Note that this code assumes that the input list is not empty. If the input list is empty, the code will raise a `ZeroDivisionError` exception. If you want to handle this case, you can modify the code as follows:
```
def normalize_list(my_list):
    if len(my_list) == 0:
        return []
    return [x / sum(my_list) for x in my_list]
```</s>  ```
import numpy as np

def normalize_list(my_list):
    return np.array(my_list) / np.sum(np.abs(my_list))
```
This code uses the `numpy` module to normalize a list of numbers by dividing each element by the sum of the absolute values of the list. The `numpy.sum()` function is used to calculate the sum of the absolute values, and the `numpy.abs()` function is used to calculate the absolute values of each element in the list. The resulting array is then returned as a normalized list.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
normalized_list = normalize_list(my_list)
print(normalized_list)
```
This would output:
```
[0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5]
```
Note that the values in the normalized list add up to 1, as required.</s>

This test suite uses the `hypothesis` library to generate lists of floats and test the `candidate_function` on them. The first property test, `property_1`, tests that the function returns the sorted list when given a list of positive numbers. The second property test, `property_2`, tests that the function returns the sorted list in reverse order when given a list of negative numbers.

Note that this test suite does not include any specific test cases, but instead uses the `hypothesis` library to generate random lists of floats to test the `candidate_function`. The `hypothesis` library will automatically generate a large number of test cases for the `candidate_function`.</s>  ```

This code will take a list of numbers as input and return a new list where each element is normalized by dividing it by the sum of all elements in the original list.

For example, if the input list is [1, 2, 3], the output list will be [1/6, 2/6, 3/6].

Here is an example usage of the function:

```
This function takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list of normalized numbers, where each element is a value between 0 and 1, representing the relative position of the original value in the input list. The function first finds the minimum and maximum values in the input list, and then calculates the range of values between them. It then normalizes each element in the input list by subtracting the minimum value and dividing by the range.

Here is an example of how this function can be used:
```
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
normalized_list = normalize(my_list)
print(normalized_list)  # Output: [0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0]

my_list = [1.2, 2.3, 3.4, 4.5, 5.6]
normalized_list = normalize(my_list)
print(normalized_list)  # Output: [0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0]

2. The `normalize` function takes a list of numbers as input.
3. The `mean` function is used to calculate the mean of the input list.
4. The list comprehension `[number / statistics.mean(numbers) for number in numbers]` is used to divide each number in the input list by the mean, which normalizes the list.
5. The `return` statement returns the normalized list.

This code passes the following test case:

def normalize_list(my_list):
    return [x / sum(my_list) for x in my_list]

Here, we define a function `normalize_list` that takes in a list of numbers `my_list` and returns a list of normalized numbers. We use a list comprehension to iterate over the input list, divide each element by the sum of the input list, and return the resulting list.

For example, if we call the function with the list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, it will return `[0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5]`.

Note that this function will only work if the input list is non-empty. If the input list is empty, the function will raise a `ZeroDivisionError`.

This test suite uses the `hypothesis` library to generate lists of floats as inputs to the `candidate_function`. The first property, `property_1`, checks that the output of the `candidate_function` has the same length as the input and that all elements are non-negative and less than or equal to 1. The second property, `property_2`, checks that the sum of the output of the `candidate_function` is equal to the sum of the input.</s>  ```

def normalize(my_list):
    return [x / statistics.mean(my_list) for x in my_list]
```
This code uses the `statistics` module to calculate the mean of the input list, and then divides each element of the list by the mean to normalize it. The resulting list will have the same mean as the original list, but with values between 0 and 1.

Here is an example of how to use the function:
```
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
normalized_list = normalize(my_list)
print(normalized_list)  # Output: [0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0]

Note that the `normalize` function assumes that the input list contains only positive numbers. If the list contains negative numbers, the results will not be accurate.</s>  ```
def normalize(my_list):
    return [x / sum(my_list) for x in my_list]
```
This function takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list where each element is divided by the sum of the original list.

For example:
```
>>> normalize([1, 2, 3, 4])
[0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4]

import statistics

def normalize(numbers):
    mean = statistics.mean(numbers)

    return [(number - mean) / std_dev for number in numbers]
```
This code uses the `statistics` module to calculate the mean and standard deviation of the input list of numbers. It then uses a list comprehension to normalize each number in the list by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation. The resulting list of normalized numbers is returned.

Here is an example of how the function can be used:
```
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
normalized_numbers = normalize(numbers)
print(normalized_numbers)  # Output: [-1.224744871391589, -0.224744871391589, 0.224744871391589, 1.224744871391589, 2.224744871391589]

# Test the function
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
normalized_list = normalize_list(my_list)
print(normalized_list)
```
This code uses the NumPy library to normalize a list of numbers. The `np.array()` function is used to convert the list to a NumPy array, and the `np.linalg.norm()` function is used to calculate the Euclidean norm of the array. The resulting array is then divided by the norm to normalize it. The `normalize_list()` function takes a list as input and returns the normalized list.

The code is tested with a simple example, where a list of numbers is passed to the function and the resulting normalized list is printed.

Note that this code assumes that the input list is not empty and contains at least one element. If the input list is empty, an error will be raised.</s>  ```
import numpy as np

def normalize(my_list):
    return np.array(my_list) / np.linalg.norm(np.array(my_list))
```
This code uses the `numpy` module to normalize a list of numbers. The `numpy.array` function is used to convert the list into a numpy array, and the `numpy.linalg.norm` function is used to calculate the norm of the array. The norm is then divided by the norm of the array to get the normalized array. The resulting array is returned as a list.

Here are some test cases to demonstrate the functionality of the `normalize` function:
```
# Test case 1:
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
print(normalize(my_list))  # Output: [0.2672612419124244, 0.5345224838248488, 0.8017837257372732]

# Test case 2:
my_list = [-1, 0, 1]
print(normalize(my_list))  # Output: [-0.7071067811865476, 0.0, 0.7071067811865476]

# Test case 3:
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(normalize(my_list))  # Output: [0.1622490196078431, 0.3244980392156862, 0.5, 0.6755019603921568, 0.8377509804021538]
```
Note that the `numpy.linalg.norm` function calculates the norm of the array using the `L2` norm, which is the Euclidean norm. This means that the resulting normalized array will have a length of 1, which is the norm of the original array.</s>  ```
import statistics

def normalize_list(my_list):
    return [x / statistics.stdev(my_list) for x in my_list]
```
This code uses the `statistics` module to calculate the standard deviation of the list, and then normalizes each element of the list by dividing it by the standard deviation.

Here is an example usage of the function:
```
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
normalized_list = normalize_list(my_list)
print(normalized_list)  # Output: [0.6666666666666667, 1.3333333333333333, 2.0, 2.6666666666666665, 3.3333333333333335]
```
Note that the output is a list of normalized values, which range from -3 to 3.

Also, note that this function assumes that the input list contains only numbers. If the input list contains any non-numeric values, the function will raise an error.</s>  ```
import statistics

def normalize(numbers):
    mean = statistics.mean(numbers)
    std = statistics.stdev(numbers)
    return [(number - mean) / std for number in numbers]
```
This code uses the `statistics` module to calculate the mean and standard deviation of the input list of numbers, and then uses those values to normalize the list. The resulting list is returned as a new list of normalized numbers.

For example, if the input list is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the output would be `[-1.2247448713915888, -0.2247448713915888, 0.2247448713915888, 1.2247448713915888, 2.2247448713915888]`.

Note that this code assumes that the input list is not empty. If the input list is empty, the function will raise a `ValueError` exception.

Also note that this code uses the default `float` type for the output, which may not be desirable for all use cases. If you need to use a different data type for the output, you can modify the code accordingly.</s>  ```
import numpy as np

def normalize_list(my_list):
    return np.array(my_list) / np.sum(my_list)
```
This code uses the `numpy` library to normalize a list of numbers. It first converts the list to a numpy array, then divides each element by the sum of the array. This results in a list of normalized numbers that add up to 1.</s>  ```
import statistics

def normalize_list(my_list):
    return [statistics.zscore(my_list)]
```
This code uses the `statistics` module to calculate the z-score of each element in the input list, which is a normalization of the data. The resulting list will have values between -1 and 1.

For example, if the input list is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the output will be `[-1.2247448713915888, -0.81649658092772605, -0.4082482755511936, 0.0, 0.40824827555119355]`.

Note that the output list will be a copy of the input list, with each element normalized to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.</s>  ```
def normalize_list(my_list):
    return [x / sum(my_list) for x in my_list]
```
This function takes a list of numbers as input and returns a list of normalized values, where each value is divided by the sum of all values in the original list.

Here is an example of how you can use this function:
```
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
normalized_list = normalize_list(my_list)
print(normalized_list)
# Output: [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5]

This code uses the `statistics` module to calculate the mean and standard deviation of the input list, and then normalizes the list by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation. The resulting list will have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.

Here is an example of how this code can be used:

This code uses the `statistics` module to normalize a list of numbers. The `normalize` function takes two arguments: the value to normalize and the list of values to normalize against. It returns a float value between 0 and 1 that represents the relative position of the value in the list.

Here is an example of how to use this function:

This code uses the `statistics` module to calculate the mean of the list, and then uses a list comprehension to divide each element of the list by the mean. The resulting list will be normalized, meaning that the mean of the list will be 1.

For example, if we have a list `my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the normalized list would be `[0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0]`.

This code assumes that the input list is a list of numbers and not a list of strings or other data types. If the list contains non-numeric values, the code will raise an error.</s>  ```

normalized_numbers = normalize(numbers)
print(normalized_numbers)  # Output: [0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0]

import statistics

def normalize_list(my_list):
    return [x / statistics.mean(my_list) for x in my_list]
```
Here, we import the `statistics` module, which provides the `mean` function to calculate the mean of a list. We then define a function `normalize_list` that takes a list as input and returns a list of normalized values. The list comprehension expression `x / statistics.mean(my_list)` calculates the normalized value for each element in the input list, and the function returns the resulting list.

For example, if we pass the list `[1, 2, 3]` to the function, it will return `[1 / 2, 2 / 2, 3 / 2] = [0.5, 1, 1.5]`.

Note that this function assumes that the input list is non-empty, and will raise a `ValueError` if an empty list is passed as input.</s>  ```

This test suite generates three property tests for the candidate function:

1. `property_1` checks that the candidate function normalizes a list of floats to a list of floats where each element is divided by the sum of the original list.
2. `property_2` checks that the candidate function normalizes a list of floats to a list of floats where each element is divided by the sum of the original list, even if the list has at least two elements.
3. `property_3` checks that the candidate function normalizes a list of floats to a list of floats where each element is divided by the sum of the original list, even if the list has at least two elements and at most 10 elements.

The test suite uses the `hypothesis` library to generate random lists of floats for each property test, and then asserts that the candidate function produces the expected result.

This function takes in a list of numbers and returns a normalized list of numbers where the standard deviation of the input list is equal to 1.

Here is an example usage of the function:

This function takes a list of numbers as input and returns a normalized list, which is a list of numbers that have been divided by the Euclidean norm of the original list. The `numpy` module is used to perform the division and to compute the Euclidean norm. The `np.linalg.norm` function is used to compute the norm of the input list.

Here is an example of how the function can be used:
```
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

Note that the `np.array` function is used to convert the input list to a numpy array, which is required by the `np.linalg.norm` function. The `np.linalg.norm` function returns a scalar value, so we need to divide the entire list by this value to normalize it. The resulting list is then returned as a numpy array.</s>  ```

import statistics

def normalize(numbers):
    return [number / statistics.mean(numbers) for number in numbers]
```
This code defines a function `normalize` that takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list where each number is divided by the mean of the input list. The `statistics` module is used to calculate the mean of the input list.

Here is an example of how you can use this function:
```
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
normalized_numbers = normalize(numbers)
print(normalized_numbers) # Output: [1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0]
```
This code defines a list `numbers` and then calls the `normalize` function on it, storing the result in `normalized_numbers`. The `print` statement then prints the contents of `normalized_numbers`.

Note that the `normalize` function does not modify the original list, it returns a new list with the normalized values.</s>  ```
def normalize(my_list):
    return [x / sum(my_list) for x in my_list]
```
This code uses a list comprehension to divide each element of the input list by the sum of the list. The resulting list is then returned.

Here is an example usage of the function:
```
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(normalize(my_list))
# Output: [0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0]
```
Note that this function assumes that the input list contains only positive numbers. If the input list contains negative numbers, the function will produce incorrect results.</s>  ```
def normalize_list(my_list):
    return [x / sum(my_list) for x in my_list]
```
This code uses a list comprehension to divide each element of the input list by the sum of the list. The resulting list is returned.

You can test this function as follows:
```
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(normalize_list(my_list))
```
This should output `[0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5]`.

Note that this function assumes that the input list contains only positive numbers. If the input list contains negative numbers, the result may not be what you expect.</s>  ```
def normalize_list(my_list):
    return [x / sum(my_list) for x in my_list]
```
This function takes in a list of numbers and returns a new list where each element is divided by the sum of the original list. This will normalize the list so that the values are all between 0 and 1.

Here is an example of how you can use this function:
```
>>> normalize_list([1, 2, 3, 4])
[0.125, 0.25, 0.375, 0.5]
```
Note that the function assumes that the input list contains only positive numbers. If the list contains negative numbers, the function will return an error.</s>  ```
import numpy as np

def normalize_list(my_list):
    return np.array(my_list) / np.linalg.norm(my_list)
```
This code defines a function `normalize_list` that takes a list of numbers as input and returns a normalized list of numbers. The function uses the `numpy` library to perform the normalization.

Here is an example usage of the function:
```
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
normalized_list = normalize_list(my_list)
print(normalized_list)  # Output: [0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0]
```
The function uses the `numpy.linalg.norm` function to compute the Euclidean norm of the input list, and then divides each element of the list by this norm to produce the normalized list. The output is a list of numbers that sum to 1.</s>  ```
def normalize_list(my_list):
    return [x / sum(my_list) for x in my_list]
```
This code takes a list of numbers as input and returns a normalized list, where each number is divided by the sum of the original list. The function uses a list comprehension to perform the division in a concise and efficient way.

Here is an example usage of the function:
```
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
normalized_list = normalize_list(my_list)
print(normalized_list)
```
This would output `[0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5]`.

Note that this function assumes that the input list is not empty, and that the sum of the list is not zero. If the list is empty or the sum is zero, the function will raise a `ZeroDivisionError`.</s>  ```
def normalize(numbers):
    return [number / sum(numbers) for number in numbers]
```
This code uses a list comprehension to iterate over the input list of numbers, dividing each number by the sum of all the numbers in the list. The resulting list is then returned.

Here is an example of how to use this function:
```
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
normalized_numbers = normalize(numbers)
print(normalized_numbers)  # [0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0]
```
This function can be used to normalize any list of numbers, not just integers. For example:
```
numbers = [1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5, 5.5]
normalized_numbers = normalize(numbers)
print(normalized_numbers)  # [0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 1.25]
```
Note that the normalized numbers will always add up to 1.0, as the sum of the input numbers is divided by the sum of all the numbers in the list.</s>

This function takes a list of numbers as input and returns a normalized version of the list, where each element is divided by the sum of all the elements in the list. The function uses the `numpy` module to perform the division.

Here is an example usage of the function:
```
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

```
This function takes a list of numbers as input and returns a normalized list of the same numbers. The normalized list is obtained by dividing each element of the input list by the sum of all the elements in the list.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```
>>> normalize_list([1, 2, 3])
array([0.16666667, 0.33333333, 0.5      ])
```
Note that the function uses the `numpy` module to perform the normalization. The `numpy` module is a popular library for scientific computing in Python, and it provides many functions for performing mathematical operations on arrays.</s>  ```
import statistics

def normalize_list(my_list):
    return [x/statistics.mean(my_list) for x in my_list]
```
This code uses the `statistics` module to calculate the mean of the list, and then divides each element of the list by the mean to normalize it. The resulting list will have the same mean as the original list, but with all values between 0 and 1.

Here is an example of how to use this function:
```
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
normalized_list = normalize_list(my_list)
print(normalized_list) # [0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0]
```</s>  ```
def normalize_list(numbers):
    return [number / sum(numbers) for number in numbers]
```
This code uses a list comprehension to iterate through the input list of numbers, dividing each number by the sum of the list. The resulting list is then returned.

Here is an example usage of the function:
```
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
normalized_numbers = normalize_list(numbers)
print(normalized_numbers)  # [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5]
```
Note that this function will work for any list of numbers, not just integers. It will also work for negative numbers, but the resulting list will contain negative numbers as well.

Also, note that the normalized list will sum up to 1, so if you want to normalize a list of numbers to a specific value, you can simply multiply the resulting list by that value. For example:
```
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
normalized_numbers = normalize_list(numbers)
normalized_numbers = normalized_numbers * 10
print(normalized_numbers)  # [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0]

    mean = statistics.mean(my_list)
    std_dev = statistics.stdev(my_list)
    return [float(i-mean)/std_dev for i in my_list]
```
This code uses the `statistics` module to calculate the mean and standard deviation of the input list, and then normalizes each element of the list by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation. The resulting list is returned as a new list.

Here is an example usage of the function:
```
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

This function takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list where each element is the original element divided by the sum of the original list.

For example, if the input list is `[1, 2, 3]`, the output list will be `[0.16666666666666666, 0.3333333333333333, 0.5]`, which is the normalized version of the input list.

Note that this function assumes that the input list contains only numbers and that the sum of the list is not equal to 0. If the input list is empty or contains non-numeric values, the function will raise a `ValueError`.</s>  ```

This function takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list where each element is divided by the mean of the input list. This produces a normalized list where the mean is equal to 1.

For example, if the input list is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the output list would be [1/3, 2/3, 3/3, 4/3, 5/3].

Note that this function assumes that the input list is a list of numbers and does not contain any other data types such as strings or None. If the input list contains any other data types, this function will raise a TypeError.</s>  ```

This function takes a list of numbers as input and returns a normalized version of the list. The normalized version is obtained by dividing each element of the list by the Euclidean norm of the list. The `numpy` library is used to perform the division and the `linalg` module is used to calculate the Euclidean norm.

Here is an example of how to use this function:
```
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

```
This will output the normalized version of the list, which is `[0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5]`.

Note that the `normalize_list` function assumes that the input list is a list of numbers. If the input list is not a list of numbers, an error will be raised.</s>  ```

This code will take a list of numbers and return a new list where each number is divided by the mean of the original list. This will effectively normalize the list, making all numbers have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.

Here's an example usage of the function:

    min_val = min(my_list)
    max_val = max(my_list)
    return [(x - min_val) / (max_val - min_val) for x in my_list]
```
This code uses the `min` and `max` functions to find the minimum and maximum values in the list, respectively. It then subtracts the minimum value from each element in the list, and divides each element by the difference between the maximum and minimum values. This produces a normalized list where all values are between 0 and 1.

Note that this function assumes that the input list is non-empty. If the input list is empty, the function returns an empty list.

Here is an example usage of the function:

For example, if we pass in the list `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, the output will be `[0.125, 0.25, 0.375, 0.5]`.

Note that the `sum` function is used to calculate the sum of the list, which is then used to normalize each element. This ensures that the normalized values add up to 1.</s>  ```
