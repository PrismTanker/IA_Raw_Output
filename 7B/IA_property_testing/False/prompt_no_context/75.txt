Prompt: Write a function that returns true if the given number is the multiplication of 3 prime numbers
    and false otherwise.
    Knowing that (a) is less then 100. 
    Example:
    is_multiply_prime(30) == True
    30 = 2 * 3 * 5
    
-------------------
  ```
    from hypothesis import given, strategies

    def is_multiply_prime(n):
        return n == 270

    def property_test(candidate_function) -> None:
        @given(strategies.integers(1, 100))
        def property_1(n):
            assert candidate_function(n) == (n == 270)

        @given(strategies.integers(1, 100))
        def property_2(n):
            assert candidate_function(n) != (n == 271)

        return [property_1, property_2]
    ```
This test suite will test the function with two different inputs:

1. n = 270, which is the input that the function should accept.
2. n = 271, which is the input that the function should reject.

The test suite will check if the function correctly identifies whether the given number is the multiplication of 3 prime numbers. The function should return true if the given number is the multiplication of 3 prime numbers and false otherwise.</s>  ```
def is_multiply_prime(n):
    if n < 100:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```
Explanation:

We first check if the given number is less than 100, if it is, we return False immediately.

Then we iterate from 2 to the square root of the given number (since we know that the number is the product of three prime numbers, so it cannot have any prime factors smaller than the square root of the number).

Inside the loop, we check if the current number divides the given number. If it does, we return False.

If we reach the end of the loop and no prime factors were found, we return True.

Note that this function assumes that the given number is a positive integer.</s>  Here is a solution to the problem:
```
def is_multiply_prime(n):
    if n < 100:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```
This solution uses the fact that if a number is the multiplication of 3 prime numbers, then it must be greater than 100. It then uses a loop to iterate over the range of possible prime factors, and checks if the number is divisible by any of them. If the number is divisible by any of the prime factors, it is not the multiplication of 3 prime numbers. If the loop completes without finding any divisors, then the number is the multiplication of 3 prime numbers.

It's worth noting that this solution is not the most efficient way to solve this problem, as it has a time complexity of O(n^0.5), which is not very efficient for large numbers. A more efficient solution would be to use the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm, which has a time complexity of O(n log log n).</s>  ```
def is_multiply_prime(n):
    if n < 100:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```
This function uses a simple approach to check if a number is the multiplication of 3 prime numbers. It iterates from 2 to the square root of the number and checks if the number is divisible by any of the numbers in the range. If it finds a divisor, it returns False immediately. If it reaches the end of the range and does not find any divisors, it returns True.

The function also assumes that the number is less than 100, which is a constraint mentioned in the problem statement. If the number is greater than 100, the function will return False immediately.</s>  def is_multiply_prime(n):
    if n < 100:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```</s>  ```

    if n < 100:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):

            return False

This function uses the fact that if a number is the product of three prime numbers, one of them must be less than the square root of the number. It then checks if the number is divisible by any prime number less than the square root of the number. If it is not divisible by any prime number less than the square root of the number, it must be the product of three prime numbers.</s>  ```
def is_multiply_prime(n):
    if n < 100:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):

            return False
    return True
```
This code uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to find all prime numbers up to the square root of n. It then checks if the number n is divisible by any of the prime numbers found. If it is not divisible by any prime numbers, then it must be the product of 3 prime numbers.

Note that this code assumes that the input number is greater than 100, as specified in the problem statement. If the input number is less than 100, the function will return False.</s>
