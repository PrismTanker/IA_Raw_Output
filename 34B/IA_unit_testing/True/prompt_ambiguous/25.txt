This function uses a simple trial division algorithm to find the prime factors of a given integer `n`. It iterates from 2 to the square root of `n`, and for each factor `i`, it checks if `n` is divisible by `i`. If it is, it adds `i` to the list of factors and recursively finds the prime factors of `n/i`. If no factor is found, the function returns the list of prime factors, which is just `[n]` if `n` is prime.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```
>>> prime_factorization(12)
[2, 2, 3]
```
This prints the prime factorization of 12, which is 2 x 2 x 3.</s>  ```

```
This function takes an integer `n` as input and returns a list of prime factors of `n`. The function uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to find all prime factors of `n`. The function first checks if `n` is even and if it is, it keeps dividing it by 2 until it becomes odd. Then, it iterates from 3 to the square root of `n` in steps of 2 and checks if `n` is divisible by any of these numbers. If it is, it adds the divisor to the list of factors and divides `n` by it. Finally, if `n` is greater than 2, it adds `n` to the list of factors.

Here are a few examples of how the function works:

* `prime_factorization(12)` returns `[2, 2, 3]`
* `prime_factorization(15)` returns `[3, 5]`
* `prime_factorization(24)` returns `[2, 2, 2, 3]`

Note that this function assumes that the input `n` is a positive integer. If the input is 0 or a negative number, the function will return an empty list.</s>  ```

Explanation:

The function `get_prime_factors` takes an integer `n` as input and returns a list of prime factors of `n`.

The function works by iteratively dividing `n` by 2 and then by the odd numbers less than or equal to the square root of `n`. When a factor is found, it is appended to the `factors` list.

For example, if `n` is 12, the function will first divide `n` by 2, which gives 6. Then it will divide 6 by 3, which gives 2. Finally, it will divide 2 by 2, which gives 1. The function will then return the list `[2, 2, 3]`.

Note that the function uses the `//=` operator, which is the integer division operator. This is necessary because we want to keep track of the exact values of the factors, rather than just their prime factors. For example, if we were to use the `/` operator instead, the function would return `[2, 3]` for the prime factors of 12, rather than `[2, 2, 3]`.</s>  ```

This function uses a simple trial division algorithm to find the prime factors of a given integer. It iterates from 2 to the square root of the input number, and for each iteration, it checks if the number is divisible by the current iteration number. If it is, it adds the current iteration number to the list of factors and recursively calls the function with the remaining number. If the number is not divisible by any number up to its square root, it means that it is prime and it adds the number itself to the list of factors.

Here's an example of how the function works:

Suppose we want to find the prime factorization of the number 120.

* The function starts by checking if 120 is divisible by 2, and it is not.
* Then it checks if 120 is divisible by 3, and it is not.
* Then it checks if 120 is divisible by 4, and it is not.
* Then it checks if 120 is divisible by 5, and it is not.
* Then it checks if 120 is divisible by 6, and it is not.
* Then it checks if 120 is divisible by 7, and it is not.
* Then it checks if 120 is divisible by 8, and it is not.
* Then it checks if 120 is divisible by 9, and it is not.
* Then it checks if 120 is divisible by 10, and it is not.
* Then it checks if 120 is divisible by 11, and it is not.
* Then it checks if 120 is divisible by 12, and it is.
* Then it adds 12 to the list of factors and recursively calls the function with the remaining number, which is 10.
* The function then checks if 10 is divisible by 2, and it is not.
* Then it checks if 10 is divisible by 3, and it is not.
* Then it checks if 10 is divisible by 4, and it is not.
* Then it checks if 10 is divisible by 5, and it is not.
* Then it checks if 10 is divisible by 6, and it is not.
* Then it checks if 10 is divisible by 7, and it is not.
* Then it checks if 10 is divisible by 8, and it is not.
* Then it checks if 10 is divisible by 9, and it is not.
* Then it checks if 10 is divisible by 10, and it is.
* Then it adds 10 to the list of factors and recursively calls the function with the remaining number, which is 1.
* The function then checks if 1 is divisible by 2, and it is not.
* Then it checks if 1 is divisible by 3, and it is not.
* Then it checks if 1 is divisible by 4, and it is not.
* Then it checks if 1 is divisible by 5, and it is not.
* Then it checks if 1 is divisible by 6, and it is not.
* Then it checks if 1 is divisible by 7, and it is not.
* Then it checks if 1 is divisible by 8, and it is not.
* Then it checks if 1 is divisible by 9, and it is not.
* Then it checks if 1 is divisible by 10, and it is not.
* Then it checks if 1 is divisible by 11, and it is not.
* Then it checks if 1 is divisible by 12, and it is not.
* Then it adds 1 to the list of factors and returns the list of factors, which is [12, 10, 1].

Therefore, the prime factorization of 120 is [12, 10, 1].</s>  ```

Explanation:

The function takes an integer `n` as input and returns a list of prime factors of `n`. The function first checks if `n` is equal to 1, and if so, returns `[1]`.

Next, the function initializes an empty list `factors` and iterates over the range of integers from 2 to the square root of `n`. For each integer `i` in this range, the function checks if `n` is divisible by `i` using the modulo operator (`%`). If `n` is divisible by `i`, the function appends `i` to the `factors` list and recursively calls the `prime_factorization` function with `n//i` (i.e., `n` divided by `i`).

If `n` is not divisible by any integer in the range, the function appends `n` to the `factors` list and returns it.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```
print(prime_factorization(12))  # [2, 2, 3]
print(prime_factorization(15))  # [3, 5]
print(prime_factorization(24))  # [2, 2, 2, 3]
```</s>  ```
def prime_factorization(n):
    factors = []
    i = 2
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i:
            i += 1
        else:
            n //= i
            factors.append(i)
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)
    return factors
```</s>  
```
def prime_factorization(n):
    if n == 1:
        return [1]
    factors = []
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            factors.append(i)
            factors.extend(prime_factorization(n // i))
            break
    else:
        factors.append(n)
    return factors
```
This code uses a recursive approach to find the prime factorization of a given integer. It first checks if the input is 1, and if so, returns [1]. Otherwise, it iterates from 2 to the square root of the input, and for each factor found, it appends the factor to a list and recursively calls the function to find the prime factorization of the input divided by the factor. If no factor is found, the input is itself a prime number, and it is appended to the list. The function returns the list of prime factors.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```
print(prime_factorization(12)) # [2, 2, 3]
print(prime_factorization(15)) # [3, 5]
print(prime_factorization(24)) # [2, 2, 2, 3]
```
This code does not use any external modules.</s>  ```
def get_prime_factors(n):
    factors = []
    while n % 2 == 0:
        factors.append(2)
        n //= 2
    for i in range(3, int(n**0.5) + 1, 2):
        while n % i == 0:
            factors.append(i)
            n //= i
    if n > 2:
        factors.append(n)
    return factors
```
This function takes an integer `n` as input and returns a list of prime factors of `n`. The function first checks if `n` is even and if it is, it adds 2 to the list of factors and divides `n` by 2. Then, it iterates over the odd numbers up to the square root of `n` and checks if `n` is divisible by each of them. If it is, it adds the divisor to the list of factors and divides `n` by it. Finally, if `n` is not 1, it adds the remaining factor to the list of factors.

Here are a few examples of how the function works:

* `get_prime_factors(12)` returns `[2, 2, 3]`
* `get_prime_factors(15)` returns `[3, 5]`
* `get_prime_factors(24)` returns `[2, 2, 2, 3]`

Note that the function assumes that the input `n` is a positive integer. If `n` is 0 or negative, the function will raise a `ValueError`.</s>
