def gcd(a, b):

```
This function uses the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers. It works by repeatedly dividing the larger number by the smaller number until the smaller number is 0, and the result is the GCD.

For example:
```
>>> gcd(10, 15)
5
>>> gcd(15, 20)
5
>>> gcd(20, 25)
5
```
This function is efficient for small numbers, but it can be slow for larger numbers. If you need to find the GCD of two large numbers, you can use a more efficient algorithm such as the binary GCD algorithm or the Stein's algorithm.</s>  ```
def gcd(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        return a
    else:
        return gcd(b, a % b)
```
This function uses the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor of two integers. The algorithm works by repeatedly subtracting the smaller number from the larger number, and returns the result of the last subtraction. The function uses a recursive approach, where it calls itself with the smaller number and the remainder of the larger number. The base case is when the smaller number is 0, in which case the function returns the larger number as the greatest common divisor.</s>  ```
def gcd(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        return a
    else:
        return gcd(b, a % b)
```
This function uses the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor of two integers. The algorithm works as follows:

1. If `b` is 0, the algorithm returns `a`, which is the greatest common divisor of `a` and `b`.
2. Otherwise, the algorithm calculates `a % b`, which is the remainder of dividing `a` by `b`.
3. The algorithm then recursively calls itself with the arguments `b` and `a % b`.
4. The algorithm repeats steps 2 and 3 until `b` is 0, at which point the algorithm returns the value of `a`.

This function is guaranteed to produce the correct result for any two integers `a` and `b`, as long as they are non-negative and the algorithm does not exceed the maximum recursion depth.

Here is an example of how this function can be used:
```
>>> gcd(12, 15)
3
```
This function can also be used with negative numbers:
```
>>> gcd(-12, -15)
3
```
However, it is important to note that the function may not work correctly if the input numbers are negative and the algorithm exceeds the maximum recursion depth. In this case, it is recommended to use a different algorithm, such as the binary GCD algorithm, which is more efficient and can handle negative input numbers.</s>  ```
def gcd(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        return a
    else:
        return gcd(b, a % b)
```
This function takes in two integers `a` and `b` and returns their greatest common divisor (gcd) using the Euclidean algorithm. The function works by recursively calling itself until the remainder of the division of `a` by `b` is 0, at which point the gcd is found.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```
print(gcd(12, 15))  # prints 3
print(gcd(15, 12))  # prints 3
```
This code will print `3` as the gcd of `12` and `15`.</s>  ```
def gcd(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        return a
    return gcd(b, a % b)
```
This function takes two integers as input and returns their greatest common divisor. It uses the Euclidean algorithm to find the gcd.

Here's an example usage:
```
>>> gcd(12, 15)
3
```
Note that this function only works for positive integers. For negative integers, you may need to modify the function accordingly.</s>  ```
def gcd(a, b):
    while b != 0:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a
```
This function uses the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor of two integers. The algorithm starts by assigning the larger number to the variable `a` and the smaller number to the variable `b`. Then, the function repeatedly divides `a` by `b` and assigns the remainder to `a`, until `b` becomes 0. The final value of `a` is the greatest common divisor of the two numbers.

This function uses the `while` loop to repeatedly apply the Euclidean algorithm until `b` becomes 0. The `while` loop is an efficient way to repeat a block of code as long as a certain condition is true. In this case, the condition is that `b` is not equal to 0.

This function also uses the `=` operator to assign values to variables. The `=` operator is used to assign a value to a variable. For example, `a = b` assigns the value of `b` to `a`.

This function also uses the `%` operator to perform the Euclidean algorithm. The `%` operator is used to calculate the remainder of two numbers. For example, `a % b` calculates the remainder of dividing `a` by `b`.

This function returns the greatest common divisor of two integers using the Euclidean algorithm.

Here is an example of how to use this function:
```
print(gcd(12, 15))  # Output: 3
print(gcd(15, 12))  # Output: 3
```
This function uses the `print` function to print the result of the `gcd` function. The `print` function is used to print a message to the console. In this case, the message is the result of the `gcd` function.

This function returns the greatest common divisor of two integers using the Euclidean algorithm. It uses the `while` loop and the `%` operator to perform the Euclidean algorithm, and the `=` operator to assign values to variables. It also uses the `print` function to print the result of the function.</s>  ```
def gcd(a, b):
    while b != 0:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a
```
This code uses the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor of two integers `a` and `b`. It works by repeatedly dividing the larger number by the smaller number until the smaller number is 0, and the result of the division is the gcd. The `while` loop continues until `b` is 0, at which point the gcd is returned.

This function will work for any two integers `a` and `b`, as long as they are positive or negative. It will also work for any size integer, as long as the computer has enough memory to store the result.

Here is an example of how this function can be used:
```
>>> gcd(10, 15)
5
>>> gcd(-10, 15)
5
>>> gcd(10, -15)
5
>>> gcd(-10, -15)
5
```
Note that the function returns the absolute value of the gcd, so the sign of the input numbers does not affect the output.</s>  ```
def gcd(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        return a
    else:
        return gcd(b, a % b)
```
This code uses the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor of two integers. The algorithm works by repeatedly subtracting the smaller number from the larger number until the smaller number is 0, and then returning the remaining value. This value is the greatest common divisor of the two numbers.

This function takes two integers as input and returns the greatest common divisor of the two numbers.

Here are some examples of how this function can be used:
```
print(gcd(10, 15))  # Output: 5
print(gcd(15, 10))  # Output: 5
print(gcd(10, 5))  # Output: 5
print(gcd(5, 10))  # Output: 5
```
This function works correctly for all positive integers, and it is efficient because it uses the Euclidean algorithm, which is a well-known and efficient method for finding the greatest common divisor of two numbers.</s>  ```
def gcd(a, b):
    while b != 0:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a
```
This function uses the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor of two integers. The algorithm starts by setting `a` to the larger of the two numbers and `b` to the smaller. It then repeatedly subtracts the smaller number from the larger number until the smaller number is 0. The last non-zero value of `a` is the greatest common divisor of the two numbers.

Here's an example of how the function can be used:
```
print(gcd(10, 15)) # Output: 5
print(gcd(12, 18)) # Output: 6
```</s>  ```
import math

def gcd(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        return a
    else:
        return gcd(b, math.gcd(a, b))
```
This function uses the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor of two integers. It first checks if the second number is 0, in which case the first number is the greatest common divisor. Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with the second number and the greatest common divisor of the first number and the second number. The `math.gcd` function is used to find the greatest common divisor of two numbers.

Here is an example usage of the function:
```
print(gcd(10, 15))  # Output: 5
```
This will return 5, which is the greatest common divisor of 10 and 15.</s>
