  Here is a sample test suite in JSON format for the given problem:
```
{
  "test1": {
    "in": {
      "n": 1
    },
    "out": 1
  },
  "test2": {
    "in": {
      "n": 2
    },
    "out": 2
  },
  "test3": {
    "in": {
      "n": 3
    },
    "out": 3
  },
  "test4": {
    "in": {
      "n": 4
    },
    "out": 4
  },
  "test5": {
    "in": {
      "n": 5
    },
    "out": 5
  },
  "test6": {
    "in": {
      "n": 6
    },
    "out": 6
  },
  "test7": {
    "in": {
      "n": 7
    },
    "out": 7
  },
  "test8": {
    "in": {
      "n": 8
    },
    "out": 8
  },
  "test9": {
    "in": {
      "n": 9
    },
    "out": 9
  },
  "test10": {
    "in": {
      "n": 10
    },
    "out": 10
  }
}
```
In this test suite, each test case represents a positive integer n and the expected output given that input. The expected output is the count of the numbers of n-digit positive integers that start or end with 1.

Note that the test suite includes test cases for n = 1 through n = 10. You can add more test cases as needed to cover a wider range of inputs.</s>  ```
def count_1_digits(n):
    count = 0
    for i in range(10**(n-1), 10**n):
        if str(i)[0] == "1" or str(i)[-1] == "1":
            count += 1
    return count
```
This code uses a for loop to iterate over the range of n-digit positive integers from 10^(n-1) to 10^n. For each integer, it checks if the first or last digit is equal to 1, and if so, it increments the count. The final return statement returns the count of the n-digit positive integers that start or end with 1.</s>  Here is a Python code that solves the problem:
```
def count_1_digit_numbers(n):
    count = 0
    for i in range(10**(n-1), 10**n):
        if str(i)[0] == '1' or str(i)[-1] == '1':
            count += 1
    return count
```
This code uses a for loop to iterate over the range of positive integers from 10^(n-1) to 10^n. For each integer, it checks if the first or last digit is 1 and increments the count if it is. Finally, it returns the count.

Note that this code assumes that the input n is a positive integer. If the input can be any integer, you may want to add a check to ensure that n is positive.</s>  Here's a sample code that should work:
```
def count_ones(n):
    count = 0
    for i in range(10**(n-1), 10**n):
        if str(i)[0] == '1' or str(i)[-1] == '1':
            count += 1
    return count
```
Explanation:

* We iterate over the range of n-digit positive integers (from 10^(n-1) to 10^n).
* For each integer `i`, we check if the first or last digit of `i` is 1. If it is, we increment the count.
* Finally, we return the count.

Note that this code assumes that `n` is a positive integer. If `n` can be negative or zero, you may need to modify the code accordingly.</s>  To solve this problem, we need to use the `str` module in Python to convert the number to a string and then check if the first or last character is 1. If it is, we increment the count.
```
def count_ones(n):
    count = 0
    for i in range(10**n):
        num = str(i)
        if num[0] == '1' or num[-1] == '1':
            count += 1
    return count
```
This function first generates all the numbers from 1 to 10^n using a loop. Then, it converts each number to a string and checks if the first or last character is 1. If it is, it increments the count. Finally, it returns the count.

For example, if we call the function with n = 2, it will return 11, since there are 11 numbers that start or end with 1 in the range of 1 to 100.</s>  ```
def count_ones(n):
    count = 0
    for i in range(10**(n-1), 10**n):
        if str(i)[0] == '1' or str(i)[-1] == '1':
            count += 1
    return count
```</s>  ```
def count_1s(n):
    count = 0
    for i in range(10**(n-1), 10**n):
        if str(i)[0] == "1" or str(i)[-1] == "1":
            count += 1
    return count
```
This code uses a for loop to iterate over the range of n-digit positive integers, and checks if the first or last digit of the current number is 1. If it is, it increments the count variable. The final return statement returns the count of the numbers that start or end with 1.</s>  To solve this problem, we can use a loop to iterate over the numbers from 100 to 999, and use the modulo operator to check if the number starts or ends with 1. We can also use the // operator to divide the number by 10 to get the last digit of the number.
```
def count_ones(n):
    count = 0
    for i in range(100, 1000):
        if i % 10 == 1 or i // 10 % 10 == 1:
            count += 1
    return count
```
This code will iterate over the numbers from 100 to 999, and check if the number starts or ends with 1. If it does, it will increment the count variable. Finally, it will return the count variable, which will contain the number of numbers that start or end with 1.

It's worth noting that this code will only work for positive integers, and will not work for negative or zero values of n. If you need to handle negative or zero values of n, you can modify the code to check for those cases and return 0 for negative or zero values of n.</s>  def count_ones(n):

Note that this code uses the built-in range() function to generate the range of numbers, and the str() function to convert the number to a string.</s>  ```
