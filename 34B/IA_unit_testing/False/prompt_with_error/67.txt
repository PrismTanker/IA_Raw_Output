Prompt: In this task, you will be given a string that represents a number of apples and oranges 
    that are distributed in a basket of fruit this basket contains 
    apples, oranges, and mango fruits. Given the string that represents the total number of 
    the oranges and apples and the total number of the fruits 
    in the basket return the number of the mango fruits in the basket.
    for examble:
    fruit_distribution("5 apples and 6 oranges", 19) ->19 - 5 - 6 = 8
    fruit_distribution("0 apples and 1 oranges",3) -> 3 - 0 - 1 = 2
    fruit_distribution("2 apples and 3 oranges", 100) -> 100 - 2 - 3 = 95
    fruit_distribution("100 apples and 1 oranges",120) -> 120 - 100 - 1 = 19

This test suite includes tests for the following scenarios:

* Zero apples and oranges
* Zero oranges and apples
* Negative apples and oranges
* Negative total fruits
* Invalid input (total fruits is a string instead of a number)

Each test includes a `name` field, which describes the scenario being tested, and an `input` field, which contains the input parameters for the function. The `expected_output` field contains the expected output for each test.</s>  ```

This code defines a function `fruit_distribution` that takes a string representing the distribution of apples and oranges in the basket and an integer representing the total number of fruits in the basket. It then splits the string into a list of strings, extracts the number of apples and oranges from the list, and calculates the number of mango fruits by subtracting the number of apples and oranges from the total number of fruits.

The function returns the number of mango fruits in the basket.

The code also includes test cases to ensure that the function works correctly.</s>  ```

This function takes in two parameters: `fruit_string`, which is a string representing the distribution of apples and oranges, and `total_fruits`, which is the total number of fruits in the basket.

The function first splits the `fruit_string` into a list of strings using the `split()` method. It then converts the first and third elements of the list to integers using the `int()` function, which represent the number of apples and oranges, respectively.

Finally, the function calculates the number of mangoes by subtracting the number of apples and oranges from the total number of fruits.

Here are some examples of how the function would work for the given test cases:

* `fruit_distribution("5 apples and 6 oranges", 19)` would return `8`, since `19 - 5 - 6 = 8`.
* `fruit_distribution("0 apples and 1 oranges", 3)` would return `2`, since `3 - 0 - 1 = 2`.
* `fruit_distribution("2 apples and 3 oranges", 100)` would return `95`, since `100 - 2 - 3 = 95`.
* `fruit_distribution("100 apples and 1 oranges", 120)` would return `19`, since `120 - 100 - 1 = 19`.</s>  ```

Here is the code that solves the problem:

1. First, we define a function called `fruit_distribution` that takes two arguments: `fruit_string` and `total_fruits`.
2. We use the `split` method to split the `fruit_string` into a list of two elements, where the first element is the number of apples and the second element is the number of oranges.
3. We use the `split` method again to split each element in the list into a list of two elements, where the first element is the number of fruits and the second element is the fruit name.
4. We use the `int` function to convert the string representation of the number of fruits into an integer.
5. We use the `total_fruits` variable to calculate the number of mango fruits by subtracting the number of apples and oranges from the total number of fruits.
6. We return the number of mango fruits.

Note that this code assumes that the input string is in the format "X apples and Y oranges", where X and Y are integers. If the input string is in a different format, the code may need to be modified accordingly.</s>  ```
def fruit_distribution(fruit_string, total_fruits):
    fruit_list = fruit_string.split(" and ")
    apple_count = int(fruit_list[0].split(" ")[0])
    orange_count = int(fruit_list[1].split(" ")[0])
    mango_count = total_fruits - apple_count - orange_count
    return mango_count
```
This function takes in two parameters: `fruit_string` and `total_fruits`. The `fruit_string` is a string that represents the distribution of apples and oranges in the basket, and the `total_fruits` is the total number of fruits in the basket.

The function first splits the `fruit_string` into a list of strings using the " and " separator. It then extracts the number of apples and oranges from the list using the `split()` method and converts them to integers.

The function then calculates the number of mango fruits by subtracting the number of apples and oranges from the total number of fruits.

Finally, the function returns the number of mango fruits.</s>  ```

    apple_count = int(fruit_list[0])
    orange_count = int(fruit_list[2])
    return total_fruits - apple_count - orange_count
```
Note that this code assumes that the input string will always be in the format "X apples and Y oranges", where X and Y are integers. If the input string is in a different format, the code will not work correctly. Additionally, this code does not handle any errors that may occur if the input string is not in the correct format.</s>
