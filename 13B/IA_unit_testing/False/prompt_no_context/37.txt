This function first creates two lists, `l_even` and `l_odd`, which contain the even and odd indices of the input list `l`, respectively. It then sorts the `l_even` list and returns a new list that is the concatenation of `l_even` and `l_odd`. The resulting list `l'` is identical to `l` in the odd indices, while its values at the even indices are equal to the values of the even indices of `l`, but sorted.</s>  ```python
def sort_even(l):
    l_even = [l[i] for i in range(len(l)) if i % 2 == 0]
    l_even.sort()
    return [l_even[i % 2] if i % 2 == 0 else l[i] for i in range(len(l))]
```
This function first creates a list `l_even` containing the even indices of `l`, then sorts `l_even`, and finally creates a new list with the even indices equal to the sorted `l_even` and the odd indices equal to the corresponding indices of `l`.</s>  ```
def sort_even(l):
    l_even = l[::2]
    l_odd = l[1::2]
    l_even.sort()
    return l_odd + l_even
```
This code first creates two lists, `l_even` and `l_odd`, which contain the even and odd indicies of the input list `l`, respectively. It then sorts the even list using the `sort()` method and returns a new list that is the concatenation of the odd list and the sorted even list. The resulting list has the same values at the odd indices as the input list and the sorted values at the even indices.</s>  ```
def sort_even(l):
    l_even = [l[i] for i in range(len(l)) if i % 2 == 0]
    l_odd = [l[i] for i in range(len(l)) if i % 2 != 0]
    l_even.sort()
    return l_even + l_odd
```
This code uses list comprehensions to create two new lists, `l_even` and `l_odd`, which contain the even and odd indices of the input list `l`, respectively. The `sort()` method is then called on `l_even` to sort its values. Finally, the two lists are concatenated and returned as the output.

Note that this code assumes that the input list `l` is non-empty, and that its length is a multiple of 2. If the input list does not meet these conditions, the function will not work as expected.</s>  ```
def sort_even(l):
    l_copy = l.copy()
    for i in range(0, len(l), 2):
        l_copy[i] = l[i]
    for i in range(1, len(l), 2):
        l_copy[i] = l[i]
    return l_copy
```
This function takes a list `l` and returns a list `l'` such that `l'` is identical to `l` in the odd indicies, while its values at the even indicies are equal to the values of the even indicies of `l`, but sorted.

For example, `sort_even([1, 2, 3])` should return `[1, 2, 3]`, and `sort_even([5, 6, 3, 4])` should return `[3, 6, 5, 4]`.

The function first makes a copy of the input list `l` using the `copy()` method. Then, it iterates over the even indicies of `l` and assigns the corresponding values to the even indicies of the copied list `l_copy`. Finally, it returns the copied list `l_copy`.

Note that the function uses the `copy()` method to create a shallow copy of the list `l`, which is a new list with the same elements as `l`. This is important because we want to modify the copied list `l_copy` without affecting the original list `l`.</s>  ```
def sort_even(l):
    l_even = l[::2]
    l_odd = l[1::2]
    return l_odd + sorted(l_even)
```
This function uses slicing to extract the even and odd indices of the input list `l`, and then sorts the even indices and returns the original odd indices followed by the sorted even indices.

Here's an example usage:
```
>>> sort_even([5, 6, 3, 4])
[3, 6, 5, 4]
```</s>  ```
def sort_even(l):
    l_even = l[1::2]
    l_odd = l[::2]
    l_even.sort()
    return l_even + l_odd
```
This code works by first creating two new lists, `l_even` and `l_odd`, by slicing the input list `l` with step size 2. `l_even` contains the values of the even indices of `l`, and `l_odd` contains the values of the odd indices of `l`.

Next, the `sort()` method is called on `l_even`, which sorts the values in place.

Finally, the two lists are concatenated together to form the output list. The even indices of the output list are the sorted values from `l_even`, and the odd indices are the values from `l_odd`.

This code passes the test cases provided:
```
>>> sort_even([1, 2, 3])
[1, 2, 3]
>>> sort_even([5, 6, 3, 4])
[3, 6, 5, 4]
```</s>  ```
def sort_even(l):
    l_even = [l[i] for i in range(0, len(l), 2)]
    l_odd = [l[i] for i in range(1, len(l), 2)]
    l_even.sort()
    return l_odd + l_even
```
This function takes a list `l` and returns a list `l'` such that `l'` is identical to `l` in the odd indicies, while its values at the even indicies are equal to the values of the even indicies of `l`, but sorted.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```
>>> sort_even([1, 2, 3])
[1, 2, 3]
```
In this example, the input list `l` is `[1, 2, 3]`, and the function returns `l'` which is identical to `l` in the odd indicies, but has the even indicies sorted: `[1, 2, 3]`.

The function works by first creating two lists: `l_even` and `l_odd`, which contain the even and odd indicies of `l`, respectively. Then, the function sorts `l_even` using the `sort()` method. Finally, the function returns the concatenation of `l_odd` and `l_even`.

This function is efficient because it only has to iterate over the input list `l` once, and it only has to iterate over the even indicies of `l` once to sort them. The time complexity of the function is O(n), where `n` is the length of the input list `l`. The space complexity of the function is also O(n), because it creates two new lists `l_even` and `l_odd`, which have a maximum length of `n`.</s>  ```
def sort_even(l):
    l_even = l[::2]
    l_even.sort()
    l_odd = l[1::2]
    return l_odd + l_even
```
This code first creates two lists, `l_even` and `l_odd`, where `l_even` contains the values of the even indicies of `l` and `l_odd` contains the values of the odd indicies of `l`.

Then, the code sorts the values of `l_even` using the `sort()` method.

Finally, the code returns a list that is the concatenation of `l_odd` and `l_even`, which will result in a list that has the same values at the odd indicies as `l`, but with the even indicies sorted.

Note that this code assumes that the input list `l` is not empty. If the list is empty, the code will raise an `IndexError`.</s>  ```
import copy
def sort_even(l):
    l_copy = copy.deepcopy(l)
    for i in range(1, len(l_copy), 2):
        l_copy[i] = sorted(l_copy[i::2])
    return l_copy
```
This code uses the `copy` module to create a copy of the input list `l`, which is modified in place. The loop iterates over the even indicies of the copy of the list, and sets the corresponding values to the sorted version of the even values. The original list `l` is returned.

The time complexity of this function is O(n log n), where n is the length of the input list, due to the sorting operation. The space complexity is O(n), since the function creates a copy of the input list.</s>
