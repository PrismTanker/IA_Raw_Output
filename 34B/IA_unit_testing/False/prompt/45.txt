Prompt: 

def triangle_area(a, h):

-------------------
  Here is a test suite for the `triangle_area` function:
```
{
    "triangle_area_test1": {
        "in": {
            "a": 5,
            "h": 3
        },
        "out": 7.5
    },
    "triangle_area_test2": {
        "in": {
            "a": 10,
            "h": 6
        },
        "out": 30
    },
    "triangle_area_test3": {
        "in": {
            "a": 20,
            "h": 10
        },
        "out": 100
    }
}
```
This test suite includes three test cases, each with a different input and output. The first test case tests the function with the values 5 and 3, which should return 7.5. The second test case tests the function with the values 10 and 6, which should return 30. The third test case tests the function with the values 20 and 10, which should return 100.</s>  ```
def triangle_area(a, h):
    return (a * h) / 2
```
Note: The formula for the area of a triangle is (base * height) / 2, so we multiply the length of the side (a) by the height (h) and then divide by 2 to get the area.</s>  ```
