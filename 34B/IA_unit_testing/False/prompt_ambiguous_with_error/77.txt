def is_cube(n):
    return n > 0 and (n ** (1/3)) % 1 == 0
```
Explanation:

The function `is_cube` takes an integer `n` as input and returns `True` if `n` is a cube, and `False` otherwise.

The function first checks if `n` is positive, since negative numbers cannot be cubes. Then, it checks if the cube root of `n` is an integer by using the modulo operator (`%`). If the result of the modulo operation is 0, then `n` is a cube. Otherwise, it is not a cube.

Here is an example usage of the function:
```
print(is_cube(8))   # True
print(is_cube(10))  # False
print(is_cube(-1))  # False
```</s>  ```
def is_cube(n):
    return n > 0 and (n ** (1/3)) % 1 == 0
```
Explanation:

This function takes a single argument `n` and checks if it is a cube by using the formula for a cube, which is `n = x^3`, where `x` is a positive integer.

First, we check if `n` is greater than 0, since the cube root of a negative number is not defined.

Next, we check if the cube root of `n` is an integer by taking the modulus of `n` and 1. If the result is 0, then `n` is a cube.

Finally, we return `True` if `n` is a cube, and `False` otherwise.

Here are some examples of how this function works:
```
>>> is_cube(1)
True
>>> is_cube(8)
True
>>> is_cube(27)
True
>>> is_cube(10)
False
>>> is_cube(-1)
False
```</s>  ```
def is_cube(n):
    return int(n**(1/3))**3 == n
```
Explanation:

The `is_cube` function takes an integer `n` as input and returns `True` if `n` is a cube, and `False` otherwise.

The function first calculates the cube root of `n` using the exponentiation operator (`**`) and then checks if the result is equal to `n` by using the modulo operator (`%`). If the result is equal to `n`, then `n` is a cube, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, the function returns `False`.

Note that the function uses the `int` function to convert the result of the exponentiation to an integer, since the modulo operator requires integer operands.</s>  ```
def is_cube(n):
    return n > 0 and (n ** (1/3)) % 1 == 0
```
This function takes a number `n` as input and returns `True` if `n` is a cube, and `False` otherwise.

Here's an explanation of how the function works:

1. `n > 0`: This checks if `n` is positive. If `n` is negative, it cannot be a cube.
2. `(n ** (1/3)) % 1 == 0`: This calculates the cube root of `n` using the exponentiation operator (`**`) and the modulo operator (`%`). The result is compared to 1 to check if it's an integer. If the result is not an integer, then `n` is not a cube.

Here are some examples of how the function works:

* `is_cube(1)`: `1 ** (1/3) = 1`, so `1` is a cube.
* `is_cube(8)`: `8 ** (1/3) = 2`, so `8` is a cube.
* `is_cube(10)`: `10 ** (1/3) = 1.6666666666666667`, so `10` is not a cube.

Note that this function assumes that `n` is an integer. If `n` can be a non-integer, you may need to modify the function to handle that case.</s>  ```
def is_cube(n):
    return int(n ** (1/3)) ** 3 == n
```
Explanation:

The function `is_cube` takes an integer `n` as input and returns `True` if `n` is a cube of an integer, and `False` otherwise.

To check if `n` is a cube, we first calculate the cube root of `n` using the formula `n ** (1/3)`. We then check if the cube of this result is equal to `n`. If it is, `n` is a cube.

For example, if `n = 27`, `n ** (1/3) = 3`, and `3 ** 3 = 27`, so `is_cube(27)` returns `True`. If `n = 10`, `n ** (1/3) = 1.58`, and `1.58 ** 3 = 5.34`, so `is_cube(10)` returns `False`.</s>  ```
def is_cube(n):
    return int(n ** (1/3)) ** 3 == n
```
Explanation:

The function `is_cube` takes an integer `n` as input and returns `True` if `n` is a cube, and `False` otherwise.

The function first checks if `n` is a perfect cube by computing `n ** (1/3)`, which gives the cube root of `n`. If `n` is not a perfect cube, this expression will not be an integer, and the function returns `False`.

If `n` is a perfect cube, the function computes `int(n ** (1/3)) ** 3` to get the cube of the cube root of `n`, which should be equal to `n`. If the result is equal to `n`, the function returns `True`, otherwise it returns `False`.</s>  ```
def is_cube(n):
    return int(n ** 0.3) ** 3 == n
```
This function takes a number `n` as input and returns `True` if it is a cube, and `False` otherwise.

Here's how it works:

1. First, we check if `n` is a perfect cube by raising it to the power of 0.3 (i.e., `n ** 0.3`). This gives us the cube root of `n`.
2. Next, we raise the result to the power of 3 (i.e., `(n ** 0.3) ** 3`) to get the original number back.
3. If the result of step 2 is equal to `n`, then `n` is a cube. Otherwise, it's not.

For example, let's say we want to check if the number 8 is a cube. We can call the function like this:
```
print(is_cube(8))
```
This will return `True`, because 8 is indeed a cube (i.e., 2^3).

On the other hand, if we call the function with a number that is not a cube, such as 9, it will return `False`:
```
print(is_cube(9))
```
This is because 9 is not a perfect cube (i.e., it's not equal to any integer raised to the power of 3).</s>  ```
def is_cube(n):
    return int(n**(1/3))**3 == n
```
This function takes a number `n` as input and returns `True` if `n` is a cube of an integer, and `False` otherwise.

Here's an explanation of how the function works:

1. The `int(n**(1/3))` expression calculates the integer part of `n` raised to the power of `1/3`. This gives us the integer part of the cube root of `n`.
2. The `**3` expression raises the result of the previous expression to the power of 3. This gives us the cube of the integer part of the cube root of `n`.
3. The `==` operator compares the result of the previous expression to `n`. If the result is equal to `n`, then `n` is a cube of an integer, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, the function returns `False`.

Here are some examples of how the function works:
```
>>> is_cube(1)
True
>>> is_cube(8)
True
>>> is_cube(9)
False
>>> is_cube(16)
True
>>> is_cube(27)
True
>>> is_cube(32)
False
```</s>  ```
def is_cube(n):
    return int(n**(1/3))**3 == n
```
This function takes an integer `n` as input and returns `True` if it is a cube of an integer, and `False` otherwise.

Here's an explanation of how the function works:

* `n**(1/3)` raises `n` to the power of `1/3`, which gives us the cube root of `n`.
* `int(n**(1/3))` converts the result to an integer, which gives us the integer part of the cube root of `n`.
* `int(n**(1/3))**3` raises the integer part of the cube root of `n` to the power of 3, which gives us the cube of the integer part of the cube root of `n`.
* `n == int(n**(1/3))**3` checks if `n` is equal to the cube of the integer part of the cube root of `n`. If it is, then `n` is a cube, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, `n` is not a cube, and the function returns `False`.

Here's an example of how to use the function:
```
print(is_cube(8)) # Should print True
print(is_cube(9)) # Should print False
print(is_cube(125)) # Should print True
print(is_cube(126)) # Should print False
```
This code will print `True`, `False`, `True`, and `False`, respectively.</s>  ```
def is_cube(n):
    return n > 0 and (n ** (1/3)) % 1 == 0
```
This function takes a number `n` as input and returns `True` if `n` is a cube, and `False` otherwise.

Here's how it works:

* First, we check if `n` is positive. If it's not, it can't be a cube.
* Next, we calculate the cube root of `n` using the exponentiation operator (`**`).
* We then check if the result of the exponentiation is equal to the original number `n` (i.e., `n ** (1/3) == n`). If it is, then `n` is a cube.
* Otherwise, `n` is not a cube.

Here are some examples of how you can use this function:
```
>>> is_cube(8)
True
>>> is_cube(9)
False
>>> is_cube(-8)
False
```</s>
