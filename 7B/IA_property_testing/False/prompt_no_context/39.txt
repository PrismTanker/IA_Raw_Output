    This test suite uses the Hypothesis library to generate random inputs for the function `prime_fib` and checks that the output is either 2 or 3 for the first two tests, and that the output is in the list of Fibonacci prime numbers for the second test.</s>  ```
def prime_fib(n):
    a, b = 0, 1
    for _ in range(n):
        a, b = b, a + b
        if is_prime(a) and a > b:
            return a
    return b

def is_prime(n):
    if n == 1 or n == 0:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```</s>  To solve this problem, we need to find the n-th Fibonacci number that is also a prime number. We can use the fact that the Fibonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence relation F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2), where F(n) is the n-th Fibonacci number. We can also use the fact that a number is prime if and only if it is divisible only by 1 and itself.

Here is a Python code that solves the problem:
```
def prime_fib(n):
    a, b = 0, 1
    for i in range(n):
        a, b = b, a + b
        if a % 2 == 0 and a % 3 == 0:
            return a
    return a
```
This code uses a loop to iterate over the first n Fibonacci numbers, and checks if each number is prime by dividing it by 2 and 3. If a number is not divisible by 2 or 3, it must be prime, and we return it. If all the numbers are divisible by 2 or 3, the last number in the sequence is the n-th prime Fibonacci number.

The time complexity of this code is O(n), where n is the number of Fibonacci numbers to be checked. The space complexity is O(1), as we only need to store the last two numbers in the sequence.

Note that this code uses the built-in `%` operator to perform modular arithmetic, which is equivalent to the `remainder()` function in Python.</s>  def prime_fib(n):
    # Use the Fibonacci sequence to generate the n-th prime number
    a, b = 0, 1
    for i in range(n):
        a, b = b, a + b
        if is_prime(a):
            return a

def is_prime(n):
    # Check if a number is prime by iterating from 2 to the square root of n
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
