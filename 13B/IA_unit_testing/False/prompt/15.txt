def string_sequence(n: int) -> str:
    return " ".join(map(str, range(n+1)))
```
This code uses the built-in `range` function to generate a sequence of numbers from 0 to `n` inclusive, and then uses the `map` function to convert each number to a string. Finally, it uses the `join` method to join the strings with spaces.

Here's an example usage:
```
>>> string_sequence(5)
'0 1 2 3 4 5'
```</s>  ```
def string_sequence(n: int) -> str:
    return ' '.join(map(str, range(n+1)))
```

This code uses the `range` function to generate a range of numbers from 0 to n inclusive, and the `map` function to convert the numbers to strings. The resulting list of strings is then joined with the `' '` string using the `join` method.

The `map` function takes a function and an iterable, and applies the function to each element of the iterable, producing a new iterable with the results. In this case, we are passing the `str` function, which converts each number to a string, and the range of numbers from 0 to n inclusive. The resulting list of strings is then joined with the `' '` string using the `join` method, producing the desired output.

Note that the `range` function produces a range of numbers, not a string, so we need to convert the numbers to strings using the `str` function before joining them with the `' '` string.</s>  ```
def string_sequence(n: int) -> str:
    return " ".join(map(str, range(n+1)))
```
This code uses the built-in `range` function to generate a sequence of numbers from 0 to `n` inclusive, and then uses the `join` method to join them with spaces. The `map` function is used to convert each number to a string before joining them. The `str.join` method is used to join the strings together with spaces.

For example, if `n=5`, the output will be `'0 1 2 3 4 5'`.

The time complexity of this code is O(n), where `n` is the value of `n` passed to the function. The space complexity is O(n) because a new list is created to store the sequence of numbers.</s>  ```
def string_sequence(n: int) -> str:
    return " ".join(map(str, range(n+1)))
```

This code uses the `map()` function to apply the `str()` function to each element of the `range(n+1)` sequence, which generates a sequence of numbers from 0 to n inclusive, and then uses the `" ".join()` method to join the resulting sequence of strings with spaces. The `+1` in the `range()` function is to include the number 0 in the sequence.</s>  ```
def string_sequence(n: int) -> str:
    return ' '.join(map(str, range(n+1)))
```
This code uses the `map()` function to apply the `str()` function to each element in the `range(n+1)` list, which generates a list of strings. The `join()` method is then used to join the elements of the list with a space character.

The `range(n+1)` list generates a list of numbers from 0 to n inclusive, and the `map()` function applies the `str()` function to each element in the list, converting each number to a string. The `join()` method then joins the strings in the list with a space character, producing the desired output.

This code passes the test cases you provided:
```
>>> string_sequence(0)
'0'
>>> string_sequence(5)
'0 1 2 3 4 5'
```</s>  ```
def string_sequence(n: int) -> str:
    return ' '.join(map(str, range(n+1)))
```
This code uses the built-in `range()` function to generate a sequence of numbers from 0 to n, and then uses the `map()` function to convert each number to a string. Finally, it uses the `join()` method to combine the strings into a single string with spaces between them.

Here are some test cases to demonstrate how the code works:
```
print(string_sequence(0))  # Output: '0'
print(string_sequence(5))  # Output: '0 1 2 3 4 5'
```</s>     

```
def string_sequence(n: int) -> str:
    return ' '.join(map(str, range(n+1)))
```

This code uses the `map()` function to apply the `str()` function to each element of the `range(n+1)` iterator, which generates a sequence of numbers from 0 to n inclusive. The resulting list is then joined with spaces using the `join()` method of the `str` class.

For example, `map(str, range(5))` would produce the list `['0', '1', '2', '3', '4']`, which is then joined with spaces to produce the string `'0 1 2 3 4'`.

This solution obeys the constraints and passes the given test cases.</s>  ```
def string_sequence(n: int) -> str:
    return ' '.join(map(str, range(n+1)))
```

This code uses the `map()` function to apply the `str()` function to each integer in the range from 0 to `n` inclusive, and then uses the `' '.join()` method to concatenate the resulting strings into a single string with spaces separating each number. The `range()` function is used to generate the range of numbers from 0 to `n` inclusive, and the `+1` is added to the end of the range to include the value of `n` in the sequence.

For example, if `n` is 5, then the range of numbers is `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, and the resulting string sequence would be `'0 1 2 3 4 5'`.

The `map()` function is used to apply the `str()` function to each number in the range, which converts each number to a string. The `join()` method is then used to concatenate the resulting strings into a single string with spaces separating each number.

Note that this code assumes that `n` is a non-negative integer. If `n` is a negative integer, then the range of numbers will be empty, and the resulting string sequence will be empty.</s>  ```
def string_sequence(n: int) -> str:
    return ' '.join(map(str, range(n+1)))
```
This code uses the `map()` function to apply the `str()` function to each number in the range from 0 to `n`, inclusive, and then joins the resulting list of strings with spaces using the `' '.join()` method. The `range()` function is used to generate the sequence of numbers, and the `+1` is added to the `n` parameter to ensure that the last number in the sequence is included.</s>  ```
def string_sequence(n: int) -> str:
    return ' '.join(map(str, range(n+1)))
```

This code uses the `map()` function to apply the `str()` function to each element of the `range(n+1)` sequence, which returns a sequence of strings. Then, it uses the `join()` method to join the elements of the resulting sequence with spaces, producing the desired output.

Note that the `range(n+1)` sequence starts at 0 and ends at `n`, so the last element is `n`. Therefore, we need to add 1 to `n` when calling `range()` to get the desired range.</s>
