This function uses a loop to iterate from 1 to the square root of the input number, and checks if the number is divisible by each number in that range. If it is, it adds the factor to a list and updates the number to be the result of dividing the original number by that factor. This process continues until the number is no longer divisible by any number in the range, at which point the remaining factor is added to the list. The list is then returned.

For example, if the input number is 8, the function will iterate through the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, and find that 8 is divisible by 2 twice. It will then add 2 to the list twice and update the number to be 4. It will then iterate through the numbers 6, 7, and 8, and find that 4 is divisible by 2 again. It will add 2 to the list again and update the number to be 2. Finally, it will iterate through the numbers 9, 10, and 11, and find that 2 is not divisible by any of them. It will then add 2 to the list and return it.

This function passes the given test cases because it correctly returns the list of prime factors of the input number in the order from smallest to largest, with each factor listed the number of times it appears in the factorization.</s>
