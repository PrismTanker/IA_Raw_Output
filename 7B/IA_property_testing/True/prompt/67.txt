-------------------
  Here is a test suite for the `fruit_distribution` function using the Hypothesis library:
```
from hypothesis import given, strategies

def property_test(candidate_function):
    @given(strategies.text(), strategies.integers())
    def property_1(s, n):
        # Test that the function returns the correct number of mango fruits
        assert candidate_function(s, n) == n - s.count('apples') - s.count('oranges')

    @given(strategies.text(), strategies.integers())
    def property_2(s, n):
        # Test that the function returns a non-negative number
        assert candidate_function(s, n) >= 0

    @given(strategies.text(), strategies.integers())
    def property_3(s, n):
        # Test that the function returns the correct number of mango fruits
        # when the string contains no apples or oranges
        if 'apples' not in s and 'oranges' not in s:
            assert candidate_function(s, n) == n

    return [property_1, property_2, property_3]
```
In this test suite, we define three property tests:

* `property_1`: Tests that the function returns the correct number of mango fruits.
* `property_2`: Tests that the function returns a non-negative number.
* `property_3`: Tests that the function returns the correct number of mango fruits when the string contains no apples or oranges.

We use the `@given` decorator from the Hypothesis library to specify the input parameters for each property test. The `strategies` module provides a set of strategies for generating random values that we can use to test our function.

Finally, we return the list of property tests from the `property_test` function.</s>  Here is a possible solution:
```
def fruit_distribution(s, n):
    apples, oranges = s.split(' and ')
    apples = int(apples)
    oranges = int(oranges)
    return n - apples - oranges
```
This solution first splits the input string into two parts using the `split()` method, and then converts the two parts to integers using the `int()` function. Finally, it returns the difference between the total number of fruits in the basket (which is the input parameter `n`) and the number of apples and oranges.

Note that this solution assumes that the input string will always be in the format "number apples and number oranges". If the input string is in a different format, the solution may not work as expected.</s>  Here is a solution to the problem you described:
```
def fruit_distribution(s, n):
    apples = int(s.split(' and ')[0])
    oranges = int(s.split(' and ')[1].split()[0])
    mango = n - apples - oranges
    return mango
```
This solution uses the `split()` method to split the input string into two parts, separated by the word "and". It then uses the `int()` function to convert each of these parts to integers, and subtracts the number of apples and oranges from the total number of fruits in the basket to get the number of mango fruits.

Here are some test cases for this solution:
```
s = "5 apples and 6 oranges"
n = 19
print(fruit_distribution(s, n)) # should print 8

s = "0 apples and 1 oranges"
n = 3
print(fruit_distribution(s, n)) # should print 2

s = "2 apples and 3 oranges"
n = 100
print(fruit_distribution(s, n)) # should print 95

s = "100 apples and 1 oranges"
n = 120
print(fruit_distribution(s, n)) # should print 19
```</s>  def fruit_distribution(s,n):
    apples = int(s.split('apples')[0])
    oranges = int(s.split('oranges')[0])
    return n - apples - oranges</s>  ```
def fruit_distribution(s, n):
    apples, oranges = [int(i) for i in s.split(" and ")]
    return n - apples - oranges
```
This code uses a list comprehension to split the input string into two integers, representing the number of apples and oranges, and then subtracts them from the total number of fruits in the basket.</s>  Here is the code:
```
def fruit_distribution(s, n):
    apples, oranges = map(int, s.split('and'))
    return n - apples - oranges
```
This code uses the `map` function to split the string into two integers, representing the number of apples and oranges, respectively. The `map` function applies the `int` function to each element of the resulting list, converting the strings to integers.

The code then returns the result of subtracting the number of apples and oranges from the total number of fruits in the basket.</s>  Here is a Python code that solves the problem:
```
def fruit_distribution(s, n):
    apples, oranges = map(int, s.split(' and '))
    return n - apples - oranges
```
Explanation:

* The `map()` function is used to split the input string `s` into a list of two elements, where the first element is the number of apples and the second element is the number of oranges.
* The `int()` function is used to convert the two elements of the list to integers.
* The function returns the number of mango fruits in the basket, which is calculated by subtracting the number of apples and oranges from the total number of fruits in the basket.

Note that this code assumes that the input string `s` will always have the format "number of apples and number of oranges". If the input string can have other formats, you may need to modify the code accordingly.</s>  Here is a solution to the problem:
```
def fruit_distribution(s, n):
    apples, oranges = map(int, s.split(' and '))
    mango = n - apples - oranges
    return mango
```
Explanation:

The `map()` function takes a function and an iterable as its arguments. In this case, we are passing the `int()` function as the first argument and the string `s` as the second argument. The `int()` function takes a string as its argument and returns the integer value of that string.

The `split()` method is then called on the string `s` to split it into two substrings based on the pattern `and`. The resulting list of substrings is then unpacked into two variables, `apples` and `oranges`.

Finally, the `mango` variable is assigned the value of `n` minus the sum of `apples` and `oranges`.

Note that this solution assumes that the input string will always have the format "x apples and y oranges", where x and y are integers. If the input string is not in this format, the solution may produce incorrect results.</s>  def fruit_distribution(s, n):

  Here is a test suite that can be used to test a future solution to the fruit_distribution problem:

    def property_2(s, n):
        result = candidate_function(s, n)
        assert result < n

    return [property_1, property_2]
```
This test suite uses the Hypothesis library to generate inputs for the candidate function, and then applies the candidate function to these inputs. It then asserts that the output of the candidate function is greater than 0 and less than the total number of fruits in the basket.

The `strategies` module provides a variety of strategies for generating inputs for the candidate function, including text and integers. The `given` decorator is used to define the inputs and the expected output of the candidate function.

The `property_test` function returns a list of property tests, which can be used to test the candidate function. The `property_1` and `property_2` functions are the property tests defined in the `property_test` function.

To run the test suite, you can use the `hypothesis.run` function, which takes the candidate function and the property tests as input. For example:
```
from hypothesis import run

candidate_function = fruit_distribution
property_tests = property_test(candidate_function)
run(candidate_function, property_tests)
```
This will run the test suite on the candidate function, and print any failures or errors.

It is important to note that this is just an example test suite, and it may not be sufficient to test all possible cases. You may need to add additional tests or modify the test suite to ensure that it covers all relevant cases.</s>  ```

The `property_test` function takes a candidate function as an argument and returns a list of property tests for that function.

The `test_valid_inputs` property test checks that the candidate function returns the correct output for valid inputs, where the input is a string that represents the number of apples and oranges in the basket and an integer that represents the total number of fruits in the basket. The test uses the `hypothesis` library to generate a wide variety of valid input combinations and checks that the candidate function returns the correct output for each combination.

def fruit_distribution(s, n):

This code uses the `map` function to split the input string into two parts, the number of apples and the number of oranges. It then uses the `-` operator to calculate the number of mango fruits in the basket.

The `map` function is a convenient way to convert the input strings into integers without having to use a `for` loop. The `split` method is used to split the input string into two parts, and the `int` function is used to convert each part into an integer.

The code is tested with the following test cases:

* `fruit_distribution("5 apples and 6 oranges", 19)` returns 8
* `fruit_distribution("0 apples and 1 oranges", 3)` returns 2
* `fruit_distribution("2 apples and 3 oranges", 100)` returns 95
* `fruit_distribution("100 apples and 1 oranges", 120)` returns 19

Note that the input string is expected to contain the words "apples" and "oranges" in lowercase, and the number of apples and oranges is expected to be positive integers.</s>  ```

This code uses the `map` function to split the input string into two parts, representing the number of apples and oranges. It then subtracts the number of apples and oranges from the total number of fruits in the basket, which gives the number of mango fruits in the basket.</s>

This test suite uses the Hypothesis library to generate inputs for the `fruit_distribution` function. The inputs are generated using the `strategies` module, which provides a set of pre-defined strategies for generating random data.

The `given` decorator is used to specify the inputs to the test function. The `strategies.text()` and `strategies.integers()` functions are used to generate strings and integers, respectively.

The test function `test_fruit_distribution` takes two arguments: `input_string` and `total_fruits`. It first splits the `input_string` into three parts using the space character as a delimiter. It then calculates the expected number of mango fruits by subtracting the number of apples and oranges from the total number of fruits.

Finally, it calls the `candidate_function` with the `input_string` and `total_fruits` as input and compares the actual number of mango fruits to the expected number of mango fruits. If the two values are not equal, an assertion error is raised.

The `property_test` function returns a list containing the `test_fruit_distribution` function, which is the property test for the `fruit_distribution` function.</s>  def fruit_distribution(s,n):

    num_apples = int(s.split(' ')[0])
    num_oranges = int(s.split(' ')[2])

```
This code uses the `split()` method to split the input string into two parts at the space character. It then uses the `int()` function to convert the two parts to integers and subtracts them from the total number of fruits in the basket to get the number of mango fruits.

For example, if the input is "5 apples and 6 oranges" and the total number of fruits is 19, the output will be 19 - 5 - 6 = 8, which is the number of mango fruits in the basket.

Note that this code assumes that the input string will always be in the format "number of apples and number of oranges", where the number of apples and oranges are separated by a space. If the input string is not in this format, the code will raise a `ValueError`.</s>  ```
def fruit_distribution(s, n):
    apples, oranges = map(int, s.split())
    return n - apples - oranges
```
This code uses the `split()` method to split the input string into two parts, the number of apples and oranges, and the `map()` function to convert these parts to integers. The `n` parameter represents the total number of fruits in the basket, and the function returns the number of mango fruits in the basket by subtracting the number of apples and oranges from the total number of fruits.</s>  Here is a solution in Python:
```
def fruit_distribution(s, n):
    apple_count = int(s.split(" ")[0])
    orange_count = int(s.split(" ")[1][:-1])
    mango_count = n - apple_count - orange_count
    return mango_count
```
The `split()` method is used to divide the string into two parts, separated by the first space character. The `[0]` index selects the first part of the string, which is the number of apples. The `[1]` index selects the second part of the string, which is the number of oranges. The `int()` function is used to convert the strings to integers. The `-` operator is used to subtract the number of apples and oranges from the total number of fruits in the basket. The `return` statement returns the result of the subtraction.

This solution assumes that the input string will always be in the format "X apples and Y oranges", where X and Y are integers. If the input string does not match this format, the code will raise an error. You can handle this error by using try-except blocks to catch the `ValueError` that is raised when the string cannot be split into two parts.</s>  def fruit_distribution(s, n):

The test generates a string that represents the number of apples and oranges in the basket, and an integer that represents the total number of fruits in the basket. The test then calls the function with the given inputs and checks that the returned value is equal to the expected value.

Explanation:

The function takes two arguments: `s`, which is the input string, and `n`, which is the total number of fruits in the basket. The function first splits the input string into a list of individual words using the `split()` method. Then, it iterates over the list of words and checks if each word ends with "apples", "oranges", or "mango". If it ends with "apples", "oranges", or "mango", it extracts the number of fruits from the word using slicing, and adds the number of fruits to the corresponding variable. Finally, the function returns the total number of mango fruits in the basket by subtracting the number of apples, oranges, and mango fruits from the total number of fruits in the basket.

Note that this function assumes that the input string is well-formed, meaning that it contains only the words "apples", "oranges", and "mango", and that the numbers in the words are integers. If the input string is malformed or contains other characters, the function may not work as expected.</s>  ```

This test suite uses the `hypothesis` library to generate a set of test cases for the `fruit_distribution` function.

The `property_test` function takes a candidate function as input and returns a list of test functions that can be used to test the function.

The `test_distribution` function uses the `given` decorator to generate a set of test cases for the `fruit_distribution` function. It takes two arguments: `s` and `n`, which are the string and integer inputs to the function, respectively. The function uses the `split` method to split the `s` string into two parts, separated by the "and" keyword. It then uses the `int` function to convert the two parts to integers and subtracts them from the `n` integer to get the number of mango fruits in the basket.

The `test_empty_distribution` function is similar to the `test_distribution` function, but it uses the `given` decorator to generate a set of test cases for the `fruit_distribution` function with an empty string and integer inputs.

The `return` statement at the end of the `property_test` function returns the list of test functions, which can be used to test the `fruit_distribution` function.</s>  ```

This code uses the `map` function to split the input string into two integers, `apples` and `oranges`, using the `split` method with the argument `' and '`. The `map` function applies the `int` function to each element in the resulting list, converting the strings to integers.

The function then returns the difference between the total number of fruits (`n`) and the number of apples and oranges.</s>  ```
def fruit_distribution(s, n):
    apples, oranges = map(int, s.split(' and '))

Explanation:

The `map()` function takes two arguments: a function and an iterable. In this case, we are using the `int()` function to convert the strings of apples and oranges to integers. The `split()` method is used to split the input string into a list of two substrings, where each substring represents the number of apples and oranges. The `map()` function applies the `int()` function to each substring, which returns a list of two integers: the number of apples and the number of oranges.

The function then subtracts the number of apples and oranges from the total number of fruits in the basket (represented by the `n` variable) to obtain the number of mango fruits in the basket.

The `return` statement is used to return the result of the subtraction as the final output of the function.</s>  Here is a possible solution using Python:
```
def fruit_distribution(s, n):
    apples = int(s.split(' and ')[0])
    oranges = int(s.split(' and ')[1])
    return n - apples - oranges
```
This code first splits the input string `s` into two parts using the `split()` method with the argument `' and '`. The resulting list contains the number of apples and oranges in the string. The `int()` function is then used to convert these strings to integers.

The code then calculates the number of mango fruits in the basket by subtracting the number of apples and oranges from the total number of fruits in the basket. The result is returned.

Note that this solution assumes that the input string is in the format `"<number of apples> apples and <number of oranges> oranges"`. If the input string is in a different format, the code will not work correctly.</s>  ```
def fruit_distribution(s, n):
    apples, oranges = map(int, s.split(' and '))
    return n - apples - oranges
```
This code uses the `map()` function to convert the string representation of the number of apples and oranges to integers. It then subtracts the number of apples and oranges from the total number of fruits in the basket to get the number of mango fruits.</s>  Here is a solution to the problem:
```
def fruit_distribution(s, n):
    apples = int(s.split("apples")[0])
    oranges = int(s.split("oranges")[0])
    return n - apples - oranges
```
Here's an explanation of how the solution works:

1. First, we use the `split()` method to split the input string into two parts: the number of apples and the number of oranges. We do this by looking for the word "apples" and "oranges" in the string, and then using the `split()` method to split the string into two parts around those words.
2. Next, we convert the strings representing the number of apples and oranges to integers using the `int()` function.
3. Finally, we subtract the number of apples from the number of oranges, and then subtract the result from the total number of fruits in the basket (which is the `n` parameter) to get the number of mango fruits in the basket.

Note that this solution assumes that the input string will always be in the format "number of apples and number of oranges", with no spaces before or after the numbers. If the input string is not in this format, the solution may not work as expected.</s>  ```

**********************

  Here is a test suite for the `fruit_distribution` function using the `hypothesis` library:
```
from hypothesis import given, strategies

def property_test(candidate_function):
    @given(strategies.text(), strategies.integers(min_value=0, max_value=100))
    def test_fruit_distribution(s, n):
        result = candidate_function(s, n)
        assert result >= 0
        assert result <= n
        return [test_fruit_distribution]

    return [test_fruit_distribution]
```
This test suite contains two property tests:

1. The `test_fruit_distribution` function takes two arguments: a string `s` that represents the number of apples and oranges in the basket, and an integer `n` that represents the total number of fruits in the basket. It calls the `candidate_function` with these arguments and asserts that the result is a non-negative integer that is less than or equal to `n`.
2. The `test_fruit_distribution` function also asserts that the result of the `candidate_function` is a non-negative integer that is less than or equal to `n`. This ensures that the function returns the correct number of mango fruits in the basket, given the input string and total number of fruits.

To use this test suite, you can call the `property_test` function with the `fruit_distribution` function as an argument, like this:
```
property_test(fruit_distribution)
```
This will generate the test suite and run it against the `fruit_distribution` function. If the function passes all the tests, the `property_test` function will return a list of the test results. If the function fails any of the tests, the `property_test` function will raise an error with a message indicating which test failed.</s>  def fruit_distribution(s, n):
    apples, oranges = map(int, s.split(' and '))
    return n - apples - oranges</s>  ```
def fruit_distribution(s, n):
    apple_count = s.count("apples")
    orange_count = s.count("oranges")
    mango_count = n - apple_count - orange_count
    return mango_count
```</s>  Here is a possible solution in Python:
```
def fruit_distribution(s, n):
    apples, oranges = s.split(' and ')
    apples = int(apples)
    oranges = int(oranges)
    mango = n - apples - oranges
    return mango
```
This solution uses the `split()` method to split the input string into two parts, where the first part represents the number of apples and the second part represents the number of oranges. It then uses the `int()` function to convert the strings to integers and calculates the number of mango fruits in the basket.

Note that this solution assumes that the input string will always be in the format "X apples and Y oranges", where X and Y are integers. If the input string is not in this format, this solution may not work as expected.</s>  Here is the code for the `fruit_distribution` function:
```
def fruit_distribution(s, n):
    apples = int(s.split(' ')[0])
    oranges = int(s.split(' ')[2])
    mango = n - apples - oranges
    return mango
```
This code works by first using the `split` method to split the input string into a list of words, where each word is a number or a fruit name. Then, we convert the first and third elements of the list to integers, which represent the number of apples and oranges, respectively. Finally, we subtract the number of apples and oranges from the total number of fruits in the basket, which gives us the number of mango fruits in the basket.

Note that this code assumes that the input string is well-formed and contains only the numbers and fruit names that we expect. If the input string is not well-formed, this code may produce unexpected results or raise an error. For example, if the input string contains more than two words, or if the words are not separated by spaces, this code may not work as expected.</s>  ```
def fruit_distribution(s, n):
    apples, oranges = map(int, s.split('and'))
    return n - apples - oranges
```
This code uses the `map()` function to split the string `s` into two parts, `apples` and `oranges`, by using the separator `'and'`. It then converts both parts to integers and returns the result of subtracting `apples` and `oranges` from the total number of fruits `n`.</s>  ```
def fruit_distribution(s, n):
    apples, oranges = map(int, s.split("and"))
    return n - apples - oranges
```</s>  ```
def fruit_distribution(s, n):
    apples, oranges = map(int, s.split())
    return n - apples - oranges
```
Explanation:
The `map` function is used to split the string into two integers, `apples` and `oranges`, using the space character as the delimiter. The `int` function is then used to convert the resulting strings into integers. The function then returns the result of subtracting the total number of apples and oranges from the total number of fruits in the basket.</s>  ```
def fruit_distribution(s, n):
    apples, oranges = map(int, s.split('and'))
    return n - apples - oranges
```
This code uses the `map` function to split the input string into two parts, the number of apples and the number of oranges. Then it subtracts the number of apples and oranges from the total number of fruits in the basket to get the number of mango fruits.</s>  ```
def fruit_distribution(s, n):
    apples, oranges = map(int, s.split(' and '))
    return n - apples - oranges
```
This code uses the `map` function to split the string into two parts, then converts them to integers using the `int` function. Finally, it subtracts the number of apples and oranges from the total number of fruits in the basket to get the number of mango fruits.</s>  ```

This ensures that the function returns the correct number of mango fruits in the basket.
2. The second property test checks that the function returns the correct number of mango fruits in the basket, even if there are no oranges or apples in the basket. This ensures that the function works correctly when the input string contains no oranges or apples.

This test suite uses the Hypothesis library to generate a set of test cases for the function. The test cases are generated using the given strategy, which specifies that the input string and integer values should be randomly generated. The test cases are then passed to the candidate function, which is the future solution to the problem. The test cases are then evaluated using the assert statement, which verifies that the output of the candidate function is correct.

The test suite includes three test cases that cover a range of scenarios:

1. Test case 1: The input string contains the word 'apples' and the output should be the difference between the total number of fruits and the number of apples.
2. Test case 2: The input string does not contain the word 'apples' and the output should be the difference between the total number of fruits and the number of oranges.
3. Test case 3: The input string contains the word 'apples' and the number of oranges is greater than the number of apples, in this case, the output should be the difference between the total number of fruits and the number of apples.

Explanation:

The function `fruit_distribution` takes two arguments: `s`, which is a string that represents the number of apples and oranges in a basket, and `n`, which is an integer that represents the total number of fruits in the basket.

The function first uses the `split()` method to split the string `s` into two parts: the number of apples and the number of oranges. It then converts these parts to integers using the `map()` function and the `int()` function.

Next, the function returns the total number of fruits in the basket minus the number of apples and oranges. This is done by subtracting `apples` and `oranges` from `n`.

For example, if `s` is "5 apples and 6 oranges" and `n` is 19, the function will return 8 (19 - 5 - 6). If `s` is "0 apples and 1 oranges" and `n` is 3, the function will return 2 (3 - 0 - 1). And if `s` is "2 apples and 3 oranges" and `n` is 100, the function will return 95 (100 - 2 - 3).</s>  ```

Explanation:

The function first splits the input string `s` into two parts using the `split()` method, which is then converted into two integers using the `map()` function and the `int()` function.

Explanation:

The function first splits the input string into two parts using the " and " separator. The resulting list contains the number of apples and oranges in the basket, respectively. The function then converts the two strings to integers using the `map()` function and the `int()` constructor. Finally, the function subtracts the number of apples and oranges from the total number of fruits in the basket, which is the input parameter `n`.</s>  Here is a solution to the problem:

    apples, oranges = map(int, s.split('and'))
    return n - apples - oranges
```
Explanation:
The function first splits the input string using the 'and' keyword, which creates a list of two strings. The first element of the list represents the number of apples and the second element represents the number of oranges. The function then converts these strings to integers using the map() function and returns the result of subtracting the number of apples and oranges from the total number of fruits in the basket (n).

For example, if the input string is "5 apples and 6 oranges" and the total number of fruits in the basket is 19, the function will return 19 - 5 - 6 = 8.</s>
