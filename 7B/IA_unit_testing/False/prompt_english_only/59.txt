Prompt: Return the largest prime factor of n. Assume n > 1 and is not a prime.
-------------------
  Here's a JSON sample representing a test suite for a hypothetical solution to the problem of returning the largest prime factor of a given number:
```
{
    "test_1": {
        "in": {
            "n": 12
        },
        "out": 3
    },
    "test_2": {
        "in": {
            "n": 9
        },
        "out": 3
    },
    "test_3": {
        "in": {
            "n": 15
        },
        "out": 5
    },
    "test_4": {
        "in": {
            "n": 17
        },
        "out": 17
    },
    "test_5": {
        "in": {
            "n": 23
        },
        "out": 23
    }
}
```
This test suite includes five tests, each with a different input value for n and the expected output. The tests cover a range of values from 12 to 23, ensuring that the solution can handle a variety of inputs.</s>  ```
def largest_prime_factor(n):
    i = 2
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i:
            i += 1
        else:
            n //= i
    return n
```
This code uses a simple iterative approach to find the largest prime factor of a given number. It starts by initializing the variable `i` to 2, which is the smallest prime number. It then checks if `n` is divisible by `i` and, if it is, it updates `n` by dividing it by `i` and incrementing `i` by 1. This process continues until `i` becomes larger than the square root of `n`, at which point the largest prime factor of `n` is found.</s>  ```

    i = 2

        if n % i:
            i += 1
        else:
            n //= i
    return n
