Prompt: Return 2^n modulo p.
-------------------
  Here is a test suite to test a future solution for the problem of returning 2^n modulo p:
```
from hypothesis import given, strategies

def property_test(candidate_function) -> None:

    @given(strategies.integers(0, 1000), strategies.integers(0, 1000))
    def property_1(n, p):
        # Test that the function returns the correct result for small values of n and p
        assert candidate_function(n, p) == (2 ** n) % p

    @given(strategies.integers(0, 1000), strategies.integers(0, 1000))
    def property_2(n, p):
        # Test that the function returns the correct result for small values of n and p
        assert candidate_function(n, p) == (2 ** (n + 1)) % p

    return [property_1, property_2]
```
This test suite uses the `hypothesis` library to generate test cases for the candidate function. The `given` decorator is used to specify the inputs to the function, and the `strategies` module is used to generate random values for the inputs. The `property_1` and `property_2` functions are defined using the `given` decorator, and they test the candidate function for different values of `n` and `p`. The `property_test` function returns a list containing the property tests.</s>  ```
def power_mod(base, exponent, modulus):
    result = 1
    while exponent > 0:
        if exponent % 2 == 1:
            result = (result * base) % modulus
        exponent //= 2
        base = (base * base) % modulus
    return result
```
This code uses the binary representation of the exponent to efficiently calculate the power modulo the modulus. It first checks if the exponent is odd and if so, it multiplies the result by the base modulo the modulus. Then it divides the exponent by 2 and repeats the process until the exponent is 0. This way it calculates the power of the base modulo the modulus in O(log(n)) time.

For example, to calculate 2^16 modulo 7, the code would return 4, because 2^16 = 65536 modulo 7 is 4.

This code is a simple implementation of the binary method for modular exponentiation, which is an efficient algorithm for calculating powers of large numbers modulo a prime number. The binary method works by repeatedly squaring the base and multiplying it by the modulus until the exponent is 0. This method is used in many cryptographic applications, such as RSA encryption, because it allows for efficient modular exponentiation.</s>  To solve this problem, we can use the built-in Python module `math` and the function `pow()`. The function `pow()` calculates the value of `a` raised to the power of `b`, where `a` and `b` are integers.

Here is an example of how we can use the `pow()` function to solve the problem:
```
import math

def modular_exponentiation(n, p):
    return math.pow(2, n) % p
```
In this code, we import the `math` module and define a function `modular_exponentiation` that takes two arguments: `n` and `p`. The function calculates the value of `2^n` modulo `p` using the `pow()` function.

To test the function, we can use the following code:
```
print(modular_exponentiation(5, 13))
```
This code will output `1`, which is the result of `2^5` modulo `13`.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.</s>  ```
def pow_mod(n, p):
    return pow(2, n, p)
```
This code uses the built-in `pow()` function to compute 2^n modulo p. The `pow()` function takes three arguments: the base, the exponent, and the modulus. In this case, we pass 2 as the base, n as the exponent, and p as the modulus. The function returns the result of raising 2 to the power of n modulo p.

For example, if n = 5 and p = 13, the function will return 2^5 mod 13, which is 4.

If you need to use the `gmpy2` module to perform this operation, you can use the following code:
```
from gmpy2 import mpz

def pow_mod(n, p):
    return mpz(2) ** n % p
```
This code uses the `gmpy2` module to perform the modular exponentiation. The `mpz` function is used to convert the number 2 to a big integer, and the `**` operator is used to compute the power of 2 modulo p. The `%` operator is used to perform the modular reduction.

Note that the `gmpy2` module is not included in the standard Python distribution, so you will need to install it separately using `pip install gmpy2`.</s>  ```
def modular_pow(base, exponent, modulus):
    result = 1
    while exponent > 0:
        if exponent % 2 == 1:
            result = (result * base) % modulus
        base = (base * base) % modulus
        exponent //= 2
    return result
```
This code uses the binary representation of the exponent to calculate the modular power of the base, avoiding the need for a loop. The modulus is applied to the result of each multiplication, ensuring that the final result is in the range of the modulus.</s>  ```
def modular_power(base, exponent, modulus):
    result = 1
    while exponent > 0:
        if exponent % 2 == 1:
            result = (result * base) % modulus
        base = (base * base) % modulus
        exponent //= 2
    return result
```
This code uses the modular arithmetic to calculate the power of a number. The base case is the modulus, and the exponent is the power. The code uses the modular multiplication to calculate the power of the base, and then reduces the exponent by half using the modulus to avoid overflow. The code stops when the exponent becomes 0, and returns the result.

You can use this function to calculate the modular power of a number, and it will return the result modulo the modulus. For example:
```
print(modular_power(2, 10, 11)) # prints 2
print(modular_power(3, 20, 11)) # prints 3
```
In the first example, the result is 2, because 2^10 modulo 11 is 2. In the second example, the result is 3, because 3^20 modulo 11 is 3.</s>  ```
def pow_mod(n, p):
    return pow(2, n, p)
```
This code uses the built-in `pow()` function to calculate 2^n modulo p. The `pow()` function takes three arguments: the base, the exponent, and the modulus. In this case, the base is 2, the exponent is n, and the modulus is p. The `pow()` function returns the result of the exponentiation modulo the modulus.

For example, if n is 3 and p is 11, the function will return 2^3 mod 11, which is 8.

If you are using Python 3.8 or later, you can also use the built-in `math.pow()` function, which is equivalent to `pow()` but has a slightly different syntax:
```
from math import pow

def pow_mod(n, p):
    return pow(2, n, p)
```
This code is functionally equivalent to the previous code, but it uses the `math.pow()` function instead of the built-in `pow()` function.</s>  ```
def power_modulo(n, p):
    return pow(2, n, p)
```
This code uses the built-in `pow()` function to calculate 2^n modulo p. The `pow()` function takes three arguments: the base, the exponent, and the modulus. In this case, the base is 2, the exponent is n, and the modulus is p.

The `pow()` function raises the base to the power of the exponent, modulo the modulus. In other words, it calculates 2^n modulo p.

For example, if n = 3 and p = 11, the code would return 2^3 modulo 11, which is 8.</s>  ```
def modular_pow(n, p):
    return pow(n, p, 2)
```
This code uses the built-in `pow` function in Python to calculate 2^n modulo p. The `pow` function takes three arguments: the base, the exponent, and the modulus. In this case, the base is 2, the exponent is n, and the modulus is p. The function returns the result of raising 2 to the power of n modulo p.

For example, if n is 3 and p is 7, the function would return 2^3 modulo 7, which is 2. If n is 10 and p is 11, the function would return 2^10 modulo 11, which is 2.

This code is efficient because it uses the built-in `pow` function, which is optimized for performing exponentiation quickly. It also avoids the need for a separate `mod` function, which can be computationally expensive.</s>  ```
def pow_mod(n, p):
    return pow(n, p, 10)
```
This code uses the built-in `pow` function to calculate the power of `n` modulo `p`, with the base `10`. The `pow` function takes three arguments: the first is the number to raise to a power, the second is the power to raise it to, and the third is the modulus. In this case, we use `10` as the modulus to ensure that the result is between 0 and 9.

For example, if `n = 2` and `p = 3`, the result of `pow_mod(n, p)` would be `2^3 % 10 = 8`.

If you need to use a different modulus, you can pass it as a third argument to the `pow` function. For example, to calculate `2^n % 17`, you can use `pow(2, n, 17)`.</s>
