Prompt: Write a function that takes an integer a and returns True 
    if this ingeger is a cube.
    Note: you may assume the input is always valid.
-------------------
  Here is a test suite for the function that takes an integer a and returns True if this integer is a cube:

```
from hypothesis import given, strategies

def property_test(candidate_function):
    @given(strategies.integers())
    def property_1(a):
        assert candidate_function(a) == (a ** 3)

    @given(strategies.integers())
    def property_2(a):
        assert candidate_function(a) == (a ** 3)

    return [property_1, property_2]
```

This test suite uses the Hypothesis library to generate property tests for the function. The first property test, `property_1`, checks that the function returns `True` when the input is a cube. The second property test, `property_2`, checks that the function returns `True` when the input is not a cube.

To run the test suite, you can use the following code:
```
from hypothesis import given, strategies

def is_cube(a):
    return (a ** 3)

property_tests = property_test(is_cube)

for test in property_tests:
    test()
```
This code defines the `is_cube` function, which returns `True` if the input is a cube, and then runs the test suite using the `property_test` function. The test suite will automatically generate two property tests for the `is_cube` function, one for the case where the input is a cube, and one for the case where the input is not a cube.</s>  ```
def is_cube(a):
    return a ** 3 == a
```
Explanation:

* The function takes an integer `a` as input.
* We use the ** operator to raise `a` to the third power, which is equivalent to finding the cube root of `a`.
* We then compare the result to `a` to see if they are equal. If they are, then `a` is a cube.
* The function returns `True` if `a` is a cube, and `False` otherwise.</s>  def is_cube(a):
    return a ** 3 == a
```
Explanation:

The function first computes the cube of the input integer `a` by raising it to the power of 3. It then checks if the result is equal to the original input. If the result is equal, then the input is a cube, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, the function returns `False`.

The function does not use any modules, and it is a simple one-liner.</s>  Here is a function that takes an integer a and returns True if the integer is a cube:
```
def is_cube(a):
    return a ** 3 == a
```
This function uses the fact that the cube of a number is equal to the number raised to the third power.

For example, if a = 8, then 8 ** 3 = 8, so is_cube(8) would return True.

If a = 9, then 9 ** 3 = 729, so is_cube(9) would return False.

Note that this function assumes that the input is always valid and does not check for negative numbers. If you need to handle negative numbers, you can modify the function accordingly.</s>  Here is a solution in Python:
```
def is_cube(a):
    return a ** 3 == a
```
This function uses the fact that the cube of a number is equal to the number raised to the third power. By comparing the cube of the input number `a` to the input number itself, we can determine if it is a cube or not.

Note that this function assumes that the input is always valid, so it does not check for errors or handle any edge cases. If you need to handle invalid inputs or other special cases, you may need to modify the function accordingly.</s>  def is_cube(a):
    return a ** 3 == a
```
Explanation:

The function checks if the input `a` is a cube by checking if it is equal to the cube of itself. To do this, we raise `a` to the power of 3, which gives us the cube of `a`. If the result is equal to `a`, then `a` is a cube.

Note that we assume the input is always valid, so we do not need to check for invalid input.</s>  ```
def is_cube(a):
    return a ** 3 == a
```</s>  ```
def is_cube(a):
    return a ** 3 == a
```</s>  ```
def is_cube(a):
    return a ** 3 == a
```
Explanation:

The function first raises the input integer `a` to the power of 3 using the `**` operator. This gives us the cube of the input integer.

We then compare the cube of the input integer to the original input integer using the `==` operator. If the two values are equal, we return `True`. Otherwise, we return `False`.

The function does not use any modules, but it does assume the input is always valid.</s>  ```
def is_cube(a):
    return a ** 3 == a
```
Explanation:

The function takes an integer `a` as input and returns `True` if `a` is a cube, `False` otherwise.

To check if a number is a cube, we can simply take its cube root and check if it is equal to the original number. If the cube root is equal to the original number, then the number is a cube.

In Python, we can use the built-in `pow()` function to raise a number to a power. In this case, we can raise `a` to the power of 3 to get its cube root. We can then compare the cube root to the original number to determine if it is a cube.

For example, if `a = 6`, then `a ** 3` is equal to `6 ** 3` which is equal to `216`. Therefore, `a` is a cube.

If `a = 7`, then `a ** 3` is equal to `7 ** 3` which is equal to `343`. Therefore, `a` is not a cube.

Note that we can also use the `math.isqrt()` function from the `math` module to get the cube root of a number. This function returns the integer part of the cube root, so we can use it to check if a number is a cube.

For example, if `a = 6`, then `math.isqrt(a)` is equal to `2`, which is the integer part of the cube root of `6`. Therefore, `a` is a cube.

If `a = 7`, then `math.isqrt(a)` is equal to `1`, which is not the integer part of the cube root of `7`. Therefore, `a` is not a cube.</s>  ```
def is_cube(a):
    return a ** 3 == a
```</s>

def is_cube(a):

Explanation:

* We check if `a ** 3` is equal to `a`, which means the cube of `a` is equal to `a`.
* We use the `**` operator to calculate the cube of `a`.
* We assume that the input is always valid, so we don't need to check for errors.</s>  ```
def is_cube(a):
    return a ** 3 == a
```
Explanation:

The function first takes the input integer `a` and then uses the ** operator to calculate the cube of the number. It then compares the result with the original input `a` using the equality operator `==`. If the two values are equal, the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

The function does not use any modules or external libraries. The only thing it needs is the ** operator, which is built-in to Python.</s>  ```
def is_cube(a):
    return a ** 3 == a
```</s>  ```
def is_cube(a):
    return a ** 3 == a
```
Explanation:

The function takes an integer `a` as input and returns `True` if `a` is a cube.

To determine if `a` is a cube, we can calculate its cube root using the formula `a ** (1/3)`. If the cube root is an integer, then `a` is a cube.

We can use the built-in `pow()` function in Python to calculate the cube root. The function takes two arguments: the base and the exponent. In this case, the base is `a` and the exponent is `(1/3)`.

We can also use the `is_integer()` method of the `math` module to check if the cube root is an integer. If the cube root is an integer, then `a` is a cube.

Therefore, the function returns `True` if `a` is a cube and `False` otherwise.</s>  ```
def is_cube(a):
    return a ** 3 == a
```
Explanation:

The function `is_cube` takes an integer `a` as input and returns `True` if `a` is a cube. We can use the fact that the cube root of a cube is equal to its cube.

Therefore, we can simply check if `a ** 3` is equal to `a`. If it is, then `a` is a cube.

Note that we can assume the input is always valid, since we are given a test case to ensure that the function works correctly.</s>  def is_cube(a):
    return a ** 3 == a</s>  ```
def is_cube(a):
    return a ** 3 == a
```
Explanation:

The function takes an integer `a` as input and returns `True` if `a` is a cube. We check if `a ** 3` (i.e., `a` to the power of 3) is equal to `a`. If it is, then `a` is a cube.

Note that we assume the input is always valid, so we do not need to check for negative numbers or other edge cases.</s>  ```
def is_cube(a):
    return a ** 3 == a
```
Explanation:

* The function takes an integer `a` as input.
* We check if `a ** 3` (i.e., `a` cubed) is equal to `a`.
* If `a` is a cube, then `a ** 3` will be equal to `a`.
* Otherwise, it will not be equal, and the function will return `False`.

For example, if `a` is equal to `3`, then `3 ** 3` is equal to `27`, which is not equal to `3`, so the function will return `False`.

If `a` is equal to `2`, then `2 ** 3` is equal to `8`, which is not equal to `2`, so the function will return `False`.

And so on.

The function will return `True` only if `a` is a cube.</s>  ```
def is_cube(a):
    return a**3 == a
```
Explanation:

The function takes an integer `a` as input and returns `True` if `a` is a cube. To determine if `a` is a cube, we can simply check if its cube root is equal to itself. We can do this by raising `a` to the power of 3 and comparing it to `a`. If the result is equal to `a`, then `a` is a cube.

For example, `a = 1` is a cube because `1**3 == 1`. Similarly, `a = 8` is a cube because `8**3 == 8`. However, `a = 9` is not a cube because `9**3 == 729`, which is not equal to `9`.

Note that we can also use the `math.isclose()` function from the `math` module to compare floating point numbers. For example, `math.isclose(a**3, a)` will return `True` if `a` is a cube.</s>  ```
def is_cube(a):
    return a ** 3 == a
```
Explanation:

The function checks if the input integer `a` is a cube by raising it to the power of 3 and comparing it to the original input. If the result is the same as the original input, then `a` is a cube.

Note that the function assumes the input is always valid, so it does not check for negative values or zero.</s>

The `property_test` function takes a candidate function as input and returns a list of property tests. The property tests are defined using the `@given` decorator from the `hypothesis` library.

The first property test, `property_1`, checks that the candidate function returns the correct cube root when given an integer that is a cube. It does this by asserting that the result of the candidate function is equal to the cube root of the input integer.

The second property test, `property_2`, checks that the candidate function returns the correct cube root when given an integer that is a cube. It does this by asserting that the result of the candidate function is equal to the cube root of the input integer.

Note that the `property_test` function is a pure function, meaning that it does not modify any external state and always returns the same output given the same input. This allows us to safely use the `hypothesis` library to generate tests for the candidate function.</s>  ```
def is_cube(a):
    return a ** 3 == a
```
Explanation:

* We use the fact that the cube of a number is equal to the number itself raised to the third power.
* We can use the built-in `pow()` function to calculate the cube of a number.
* We can also use the fact that the cube of a number is always equal to the number itself raised to the third power.
* Therefore, we can write the function as follows:
```
def is_cube(a):
    return a ** 3 == a
```
This function takes an integer `a` as input and returns `True` if `a` is a cube, and `False` otherwise.

For example, if we call the function with the argument `27`, it will return `True` because `27` is a cube. If we call the function with the argument `10`, it will return `False` because `10` is not a cube.</s>  ```
def is_cube(a):
    return a ** 3 == a
```
Explanation:

The function `is_cube` takes an integer `a` as input and returns `True` if `a` is a cube. We can use the fact that the cube root of a cube is equal to its cube.

So, we can check if `a ** 3 == a`, which will be `True` if `a` is a cube.

Note that we assume the input is always valid, so we don't need to check for negative values or other edge cases.</s>  ```
def is_cube(a):
    return a ** 3 == a
```
Explanation:

We check if the input integer `a` is a cube by checking if its cube root is equal to itself. The cube root of a number is the number that, when raised to the power of 3, gives the original number.

For example, the cube root of 27 is 3, because 3 ** 3 = 27.

Therefore, we can simply check if `a ** 3` (i.e., the cube of `a`) is equal to `a` to determine if `a` is a cube.

Note that we assume the input is always valid, so we do not need to check if `a` is a valid integer.</s>  Here is a possible solution:
```
def is_cube(a):
    return a ** 3 == a
```
Explanation:
The function `is_cube` takes an integer `a` as input and returns `True` if `a` is a cube. We can check whether an integer `a` is a cube by checking whether `a ** 3` (i.e., `a` cubed) is equal to `a`. If `a` is a cube, then `a ** 3` will be equal to `a`.

For example, `5 ** 3` is equal to `5`, so `5` is a cube. Similarly, `27 ** 3` is equal to `27`, so `27` is also a cube.

Note that we can assume the input is always valid, since the problem statement states that we are given an integer `a` that is always valid.</s>  ```
def is_cube(a):
    return a ** 3 == a
```
Explanation:

The function takes an integer `a` as input and returns `True` if `a` is a cube. To determine if `a` is a cube, we can use the fact that the cube of an integer is equal to the integer raised to the power of 3.

Therefore, we can simply check if `a ** 3` is equal to `a`. If they are equal, then `a` is a cube.

For example, `is_cube(8)` would return `True` because `8 ** 3` is equal to `8`.

It's important to note that the function assumes that the input is always valid, so it does not need to handle any errors.</s>  ```
def is_cube(a):
    return a ** 3 == a
```
This function uses the fact that the cube of a number is equal to the number raised to the third power. By comparing the result of raising the input `a` to the third power to the input `a` itself, we can determine if it is a cube.</s>  ```
def is_cube(a):
    return a ** 3 == a
```
Explanation:
The function checks if the cube of the input integer `a` is equal to `a` itself. We can use the `**` operator to calculate the cube of `a`. If the cube is equal to `a`, then the input integer is a cube.

The function is simple and efficient, and it does not use any external modules. It is a pure Python function that can be used in any Python program.</s>  ```
def is_cube(a):
    return a ** 3 == a
```
This function uses the fact that the cube of a number is equal to the number itself raised to the third power. If the input integer is a cube, then its cube will be equal to the number itself.

For example, the input 125 is a cube because 125 ** 3 = 125.

The function returns True if the input is a cube and False otherwise.</s>  Here is a function that takes an integer a and returns True if it is a cube:
```
def is_cube(a):
    return a ** 3 == a
```
Explanation:

* The function takes an integer a as input.
* We check if a is a cube by checking if a ** 3 == a. This checks if a has three factors (1, a, a ** 2) and if a is a cube if and only if it has three factors.
* We return True if a is a cube and False otherwise.

Note: This function assumes that the input is always valid, meaning that it is an integer. If the input can be a non-integer value, you will need to handle that case separately.</s>  ```
def is_cube(a):
    return a ** 3 == a
```
Explanation:

The function first raises a to the power of 3 using the ** operator. This will give us the cube of the input a. We then compare the result to the original input a using the == operator. If the two values are equal, we return True, indicating that the input is a cube. Otherwise, we return False.

Note that we can simplify the code by using the built-in math.isqrt() function to calculate the cube root of a.

```
from math import isqrt

def is_cube(a):
    return isqrt(a) ** 3 == a
```
This code uses the isqrt() function to calculate the cube root of a, and then raises the result to the power of 3 using the ** operator. This will give us the cube of the input a. We then compare the result to the original input a using the == operator. If the two values are equal, we return True, indicating that the input is a cube. Otherwise, we return False.

Note that the isqrt() function returns the square root of a, but the cube root of a. Therefore, we need to raise the result to the power of 3 to get the cube of the input a.</s>

This function uses the fact that the cube of a number is equal to the number itself raised to the third power. By comparing the cube of the input integer `a` to the input integer `a`, we can determine if it is a cube or not. If the two values are equal, then the input is a cube.

For example, if we call the function with the argument `a = 6`, the function will return `True` because `6 ** 3 == 6`.

If we call the function with the argument `a = 4`, the function will return `False` because `4 ** 3 == 6` and `4` is not a cube.

def is_cube(a):
    return (a ** 3) == a
```
Explanation:

We can use the fact that the cube of a number is equal to the number itself raised to the third power. So, if we take the cube of the input number `a`, we can compare it to the original number `a` to see if they are equal. If they are, then `a` must be a cube.

Note that we can use the `**` operator to raise a number to a power in Python. In this case, we are raising `a` to the power of 3.</s>  ```
def is_cube(a):
    return a ** 3 == a
```
Explanation:

The function `is_cube` takes an integer `a` as input and returns `True` if `a` is a cube, and `False` otherwise.

To determine if an integer is a cube, we can take the cube root of the integer and check if it is equal to the original integer. If the cube root is equal to the original integer, then the integer is a cube.

In Python, we can use the built-in `math.cbrt()` function to compute the cube root of an integer. The `math.cbrt()` function returns the cube root of an integer, so we can simply compare the cube root to the original integer to determine if it is a cube.

Here is the complete code for the `is_cube` function:
```
import math

def is_cube(a):
    return a ** 3 == a
```</s>  ```
def is_cube(a):
    return a ** 3 == a
```</s>  ```
def is_cube(a):
    return a ** 3 == a

Explanation:

The function takes an integer `a` as input and returns `True` if `a` is a cube. To determine if an integer is a cube, we can simply check if its cube root is equal to itself. We can use the built-in `math.cbrt()` function to calculate the cube root of `a`.

Therefore, the function `is_cube(a)` returns `True` if `a` is a cube, and `False` otherwise.

Note that this function assumes that the input is always valid, and it does not handle any edge cases. If you need to handle invalid input, you may need to add additional checks or error handling to the function.</s>  ```
def is_cube(a):
    return a ** 3 == a
```
This function uses the fact that the cube of a number is equal to the number raised to the third power. By comparing the cube of the input integer `a` to the original input `a`, we can determine if it is a cube or not.</s>  ```
def is_cube(a):
    return a ** 3 == a
```
Explanation:

The function first raises the input integer `a` to the power of 3 using the `**` operator. This will give us the cube of the input integer.

Then, we compare the result of the `**` operator with the original input `a` using the `==` operator. If the two values are equal, then the input integer is a cube.

For example, if the input is 6, the function will return `True` because 6 is a cube (6 ** 3 == 6).

If the input is not a cube, the function will return `False`. For example, if the input is 5, the function will return `False` because 5 is not a cube (5 ** 3 != 5).</s>  Here is a Python function that takes an integer a and returns True if this integer is a cube:
```
def is_cube(a):
    return a ** 3 == a
```
This function uses the ** operator to raise the integer a to the power of 3, which will give us the cube of the integer. We then compare this value to the original integer a using the == operator, which will return True if they are equal.

Note that this function assumes the input is always valid, so if the input is not a positive integer, it may return an incorrect result.</s>  ```
def is_cube(a):
    return a ** 3 == a
```
Explanation:

The function `is_cube` takes an integer `a` as input and returns `True` if `a` is a cube, and `False` otherwise.

To check if `a` is a cube, we can calculate the cube root of `a` and compare it to the original value of `a`. If the cube root is equal to `a`, then `a` is a cube.

We can use the built-in `math.cbrt` function to calculate the cube root of `a`. If `a` is a cube, then `math.cbrt(a) == a`.

Therefore, the function `is_cube` returns `True` if `a` is a cube, and `False` otherwise.</s>

The first property test, property_1, checks that the candidate function returns the correct value when given an integer that is a cube. It does this by calling the candidate function with an integer that is a cube and checking that the returned value is equal to the cube of that integer.

In this code, we define a function called `is_cube` that takes an integer `a` as input. We use the ** operator to calculate the cube of `a` and then compare it to `a` using the equality operator `==`. If the cube of `a` is equal to `a`, we return `True`. Otherwise, we return `False`.

Note that we assume the input is always valid, so we do not need to check for any errors. Also, we do not use any modules or libraries to solve this problem.</s>  ```
def is_cube(a):
    return a ** 3 == a
```
Explanation:

The function first takes an integer `a` as input. Then, it checks if the cube of `a`, which is `a ** 3`, is equal to `a`. If they are equal, the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

The function uses the built-in exponentiation operator `**` to calculate the cube of `a`.

For example, if `a` is 2, the function returns `True` because 2 cubed is 8, which is equal to 2. If `a` is 3, the function returns `False` because 3 cubed is 27, which is not equal to 3.</s>  Here is a function that takes an integer a and returns True if this integer is a cube:
```
def is_cube(a):
    return a ** 3 == a
```
Explanation:

* The function takes an integer a as input.
* It uses the power operator (**) to calculate the cube of a.
* It compares the result of the power operator to the original input a using the equality operator (==).
* If the result is True, the function returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.

Note that the function assumes the input is always valid, meaning it will not throw an error if the input is not an integer. If you need to handle invalid inputs, you can add error handling using try-except blocks.</s>  ```
def is_cube(a):
    return a ** 3 == a
```</s>  ```
def is_cube(a):
    return a ** 3 == a
```</s>  Here is a function that determines if an integer is a cube:
```
def is_cube(a):
    return a ** 3 == a
```
This function uses the fact that the cube of a number is equal to the number itself raised to the third power. By comparing the cube of the input `a` to `a`, we can determine if `a` is a cube.

For example, if we call the function with `a = 6`, the function will return `True` because `6 ** 3 == 6`. If we call the function with `a = 10`, the function will return `False` because `10 ** 3 != 10`.

Note that this function assumes that the input is always valid. If the input is not a positive integer, this function will raise an error. If you want to handle invalid inputs, you will need to add additional error handling to the function.</s>  ```
def is_cube(a):
    return a ** 3 == a
```
Explanation:

The function `is_cube` takes an integer `a` as input and returns `True` if `a` is a cube.

We can use the fact that a cube has the form `a ** 3` to check if a number is a cube. If `a` is a cube, then `a ** 3` will be equal to `a`.

Therefore, we can simply check if `a ** 3` is equal to `a` to determine if `a` is a cube. If they are equal, then `a` is a cube.

For example, if `a = 8`, then `a ** 3` will be equal to `512`, which is not equal to `8`. Therefore, `a` is not a cube.

On the other hand, if `a = 1`, then `a ** 3` will be equal to `1`, which is equal to `1`. Therefore, `a` is a cube.

Therefore, the function `is_cube` will return `True` if the input `a` is a cube, and `False` otherwise.</s>  def is_cube(a):
    return a ** 3 == a

---

Here's a brief explanation of how the code works:

* The function `is_cube` takes an integer `a` as input.
* It uses the `**` operator to raise `a` to the power of 3, which gives us the cube of `a`.
* We then compare the cube of `a` to `a` using the `==` operator, which returns `True` if they are equal.
* If the input `a` is not a cube, then the result of the `==` operator will be `False`.

Note that the function assumes that the input is always valid, meaning that `a` will always be a positive integer. If you need to handle negative or non-integer inputs, you'll need to modify the function accordingly.</s>  def is_cube(a):
    return a ** 3 == a
```
In this code, we define a function `is_cube` that takes an integer `a` as input and returns `True` if `a` is a cube.

We use the fact that the cube of a number is equal to the number itself raised to the power of 3. For example, the cube of 2 is 2 ** 3 = 8.

To check if a number is a cube, we simply raise it to the power of 3 and compare it to the original number. If the result is equal to the original number, then the number is a cube.

Note that we assume the input is always valid, so we do not need to check if `a` is a valid number before raising it to the power of 3.</s>

def is_cube(a):

```
Explanation:

The function takes an integer `a` as input and returns `True` if `a` is a cube. We check if `a` is a cube by raising it to the power of 3 and comparing it to the original value of `a`. If they are equal, then `a` is a cube.

```
Explanation:

The function `is_cube` takes an integer `a` as input and returns `True` if `a` is a cube.

To determine if `a` is a cube, we can simply calculate `a ** 3` and compare it to `a`. If the two values are equal, then `a` is a cube.

Note that we can assume that the input is always valid, since we are given a constraint that the input is an integer.</s>  ```
def is_cube(a):
    return a ** 3 == a
```
Explanation:

The function `is_cube` takes an integer `a` as input and returns `True` if `a` is a cube.

To determine if `a` is a cube, we can simply check if `a ** 3` is equal to `a`. This is because if `a` is a cube, then `a ** 3` will be equal to `a`.

For example, if `a` is equal to 6, then `a ** 3` will be equal to 6, so the function will return `True`.

If `a` is not a cube, then `a ** 3` will not be equal to `a`, so the function will return `False`.

Note that we do not need to check if `a` is negative or zero, because if `a` is negative or zero, then `a ** 3` will be equal to 0, which is not a cube.</s>  ```
def is_cube(a):
    return a ** 3 == a
```</s>  Here is a function that takes an integer a and returns True if it is a cube:
```
def is_cube(a):
    return a ** 3 == a
```
Explanation:

* The function takes an integer a as input.
* We check if a is a cube by raising it to the power of 3 and comparing it to a. If the result is equal to a, then a is a cube.
* We return True if the condition is met and False otherwise.

For example, if we call the function with the argument 125, it will return True because 125 is a cube:
```
>>> is_cube(125)
True
```
If we call the function with a different argument, it will return False:
```
>>> is_cube(100)
False
```
Note that we do not need to import any modules to solve this problem, as the built-in pow() function can be used to raise an integer to a power.</s>  ```

def is_cube(a):

```
Explanation:

The function first takes an integer `a` as input. Then, it uses the power operator `**` to raise `a` to the third power, which is the same as calculating the cube of `a`. Finally, it compares the result of the cube calculation to the original input `a` using the equality operator `==`. If the two values are equal, the function returns `True`, indicating that the input is a cube. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

The function assumes that the input is always valid, meaning that it is guaranteed to be an integer. If you need to handle non-integer inputs or invalid input, you can modify the function accordingly.</s>  ```
def is_cube(a):

def is_cube(a):

```
Explanation:

We can solve this problem by checking if the cube of any number is equal to that number. We can use the power operator (`**`) to calculate the cube of a number.

For example, if we have a number `a = 5`, we can calculate its cube as follows: `a ** 3 = 5 ** 3 = 125`. Since the cube of 5 is 125, we return `True`.

If the input is not a valid integer, we will get an error. Therefore, we assume that the input is always valid.</s>

This test suite uses the Hypothesis library to generate property tests for the future solution to the problem. The `property_test` function takes a candidate function as input and returns a list containing the property tests.

The `property_1` and `property_2` tests use the `given` decorator from Hypothesis to generate random integers that are assumed to be valid inputs. The tests assert that the candidate function returns the correct result for these inputs.

To use this test suite, you would pass the candidate function to the `property_test` function and then run the resulting tests. For example:
```
candidate_function = lambda a: a ** 3
property_tests = property_test(candidate_function)
for test in property_tests:

This code would run the `property_1` and `property_2` tests on the candidate function, which would verify that the function correctly identifies cubes.</s>  ```
def is_cube(a):

Explanation:

The function uses the fact that the cube of a number is equal to the number multiplied by itself three times. Therefore, if the input `a` is a cube, the expression `a ** 3` will be equal to `a`, and the function will return `True`.

Note that we use the ** operator to perform exponentiation, which is a built-in function in Python.

Test cases:

* is_cube(0) should return True

def is_cube(a):

```
Explanation:

The function takes an integer `a` as input and returns `True` if `a` is a cube. We can use the fact that the cube root of a cube is equal to its cube root to check if `a` is a cube.

We can use the built-in `math.cbrt()` function to get the cube root of `a`. If the cube root is equal to `a`, then `a` is a cube.

Here's the code:
```
import math

def is_cube(a):
    return math.cbrt(a) == a
```
Note that we're using the `math.cbrt()` function to get the cube root of `a`. If we want to use a different approach, we can use the formula for a cube root: `a ** (1/3) == a`. We can implement this function as follows:
```
def is_cube(a):
    return a ** (1/3) == a
```
This function uses the formula for a cube root to check if `a` is a cube.</s>  ```
def is_cube(a):

```</s>  Here's a solution using the math module:
```
import math

def is_cube(a):
    return a ** 3 == math.pow(a, 3)
```
Explanation:

The cube of a number is obtained by raising it to the power of 3. We can use the `pow` function from the `math` module to compute this.

The function first checks if the input `a` is a cube by comparing it to the result of raising `a` to the power of 3 using the `pow` function. If the two values are equal, the input is a cube, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, the function returns `False`.</s>  Here's a solution using the math module:
```
import math

def is_cube(a):
    return a ** 3 == math.pow(a, 3)
```
Explanation:

The function `is_cube` takes an integer `a` as input and returns `True` if `a` is a cube, and `False` otherwise.

The function uses the `math.pow` function to compute `a ** 3`, which is the cube of `a`. The `==` operator is used to compare `a ** 3` with `math.pow(a, 3)`, which is the same as computing the cube of `a` using the `pow` function.

The function assumes that the input is always valid, so it does not need to handle any error cases.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```
print(is_cube(1))  # Should print True
print(is_cube(2))  # Should print False
print(is_cube(3))  # Should print True
```
This code should print `True`, `False`, and `True` respectively.</s>  ```
def is_cube(a):
    return a ** 3 == a
```
Explanation:

The function first takes the input `a` and raises it to the power of 3 using the `**` operator. This gives us the cube of the input. We then compare the cube to the original input using the `==` operator. If they are equal, the function returns `True`, otherwise it returns `False`.

It's important to note that the input is assumed to be valid, so we don't need to check for the case where `a` is negative or 0. Also, the function doesn't need to handle the case where `a` is a floating point number, as the `**` operator will return an integer.</s>  ```
def is_cube(a):
    return a ** 3 == a
```
Explanation:

The function first raises the value of a to the power of 3 using the ** operator. This gives us the cube of the input value. Then, we compare the result to the original value of a using the == operator. If the two values are equal, then a is a cube, and the function returns True. Otherwise, the function returns False.</s>  ```
def is_cube(a):
    return a ** 3 == a
```
Explanation:

The function first calculates the cube of the input integer using the ** operator. Then, it compares the result to the original input integer using the == operator. If the two values are equal, the function returns True, indicating that the input integer is a cube. Otherwise, it returns False.

The function assumes that the input is always valid, meaning that the input integer will always be a positive integer. If the input integer can be negative or zero, you will need to add additional validation to ensure that the input is valid.</s>  ```
def is_cube(a):
    return a ** 3 == a
```
Explanation:

The function first raises the input integer `a` to the power of 3 using the `**` operator. This is equivalent to computing `a * a * a`.

Next, the function checks if the result of the power operation is equal to the original input `a`. If it is, then the input `a` is a cube, and the function returns `True`.

If the result of the power operation is not equal to the original input `a`, then the input `a` is not a cube, and the function returns `False`.</s>  Here's a Python function that takes an integer `a` and returns `True` if it is a cube:
```
def is_cube(a):
    return a ** 3 == a
```
Explanation:

* The function uses the power operator (`**`) to calculate the cube of `a`.
* The condition `a ** 3 == a` checks if the cube of `a` is equal to `a`, which is true only if `a` is a cube.

Note: This function assumes that the input is always valid, i.e., it is an integer. If the input can be a string or a non-integer value, you may need to add additional error handling or validation.</s>

Explanation:

The function first raises the input `a` to the power of 3 using the bitwise XOR operator `**`. This results in a cube of the input number.

Then, it compares the result with the original input using the equality operator `==`. If the result is equal to the input, then the input is a cube.

def is_cube(a):

Explanation:

The function `is_cube` takes an integer `a` as input and returns `True` if `a` is a cube.

To determine if `a` is a cube, we can use the fact that the cube of a number is equal to the number to the third power. In other words, if `a` is a cube, then `a ** 3` is equal to `a`.

Therefore, we can simply check if `a ** 3` is equal to `a`, and return `True` if they are equal.

The function `is_cube` takes an integer `a` as input and returns `True` if `a` is a cube.

To determine if a number is a cube, we can take its cube root and compare it to the original number. If the cube root is an integer, then the number is a cube.

In Python, we can take the cube root of a number using the built-in `math.cbrt()` function. We can also use the `**` operator to raise a number to a power.

Therefore, the function `is_cube` returns `True` if `a` is a cube, and `False` otherwise.

Note that we can assume the input is always valid, since the problem statement states that the input is always an integer.</s>  ```
def is_cube(a):
    return a ** 3 == a
```
Explanation:

* We check if the cube of the input integer `a` is equal to the input integer `a` using the `==` operator.
* We use the `**` operator to raise the input integer to the power of 3, which gives us the cube of the input integer.
* We return `True` if the cube of the input integer is equal to the input integer, and `False` otherwise.

For example, if we call the function with the input `a = 8`, the function will return `True` because `8 ** 3` equals `8`. Similarly, if we call the function with the input `a = 27`, the function will return `True` because `27 ** 3` equals `27`.</s>  ```
def is_cube(a):
    return a ** 3 == a
```
Explanation:

The function takes an integer `a` as input and returns `True` if `a` is a cube.

We can check if `a` is a cube by raising it to the power of 3 and comparing it to `a`. If the result is equal to `a`, then `a` must be a cube.

For example, if `a = 8`, then `8 ** 3` is equal to `512`, which is not equal to `8`, so the function will return `False`.

On the other hand, if `a = 1`, then `1 ** 3` is equal to `1`, which is equal to `1`, so the function will return `True`.

Note that we can simplify the function by using the `is_cube` method of the `math` module, which checks if a number is a perfect cube:
```
from math import is_cube

def is_cube(a):
    return is_cube(a)
```</s>  def is_cube(a):
    return a ** 3 == a
```</s>  Here's a Python function that checks if an integer is a cube:
```
def is_cube(a):
    return a ** 3 == a
```
This function uses the fact that the cube of a number is equal to the number itself raised to the third power. The `**` operator performs exponentiation in Python.

For example, `is_cube(8)` would return `True` because 8 is a cube (8 ** 3 == 8). Similarly, `is_cube(16)` would return `True` because 16 is also a cube (16 ** 3 == 16).

Note that this function assumes that the input is always valid and does not perform any error handling. If you need to handle invalid input, you may need to add additional checks or error handling to the function.</s>  ```
def is_cube(a):
    return a**3 == a
```
Explanation:

The function first calculates the cube of the input integer `a` using the `**` operator. Then, it checks if the result of the cube calculation is equal to the original input integer using the `==` operator. If the two values are equal, the function returns `True`, indicating that the input integer is a cube. Otherwise, the function returns `False`.

The function assumes that the input is always valid, meaning that it is an integer. If the input is not an integer, the function will raise a `TypeError`.</s>  ```
def is_cube(a):
    return a ** 3 == a
```
Explanation:

The function first raises the input `a` to the power of 3 using the `**` operator. This gives us the cube of `a`. Then, it checks if the cube of `a` is equal to the original input `a`. If they are equal, then the input `a` is a cube, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, the function returns `False`.

The function assumes that the input is always valid, and it does not include any error handling. Therefore, it is important to ensure that the input is valid before passing it to the function.</s>  Here is a solution to the problem:
```
def is_cube(a):
    return a ** 3 == a
```
Explanation:

* The function takes an integer `a` as input.
* It calculates the cube of `a` using the exponentiation operator `**`.
* It compares the result to the original value of `a` using the equality operator `==`.
* If the two values are equal, the function returns `True`, otherwise it returns `False`.

Note that this solution assumes that the input is always valid, meaning that it is a non-negative integer. If the input can be negative or non-integer values, you may need to add additional checks to the function.</s>

```</s>  ```
def is_cube(a):
    return a ** 3 == a
```
Explanation:

We can use the fact that a cube has three sides of length equal to its volume to determine if an integer is a cube. We can compute the cube root of the integer and check if it is equal to the original integer. If the cube root is an integer, then the integer is a cube.

For example, if we have the integer 125, we can compute its cube root by taking its cube root:

125 ** 1/3 = 5

Since 5 is an integer, 125 is a cube.

If we have the integer 123, we can compute its cube root by taking its cube root:

123 ** 1/3 = 4

Since 4 is not an integer, 123 is not a cube.

Therefore, our function returns True if the cube root of the input integer is an integer, and False otherwise.</s>  ```
def is_cube(a):

Explanation:

The function takes an integer `a` as input and returns `True` if `a` is a cube. We use the fact that the cube of a number is equal to the number itself raised to the third power.

For example, the cube of 3 is 3 ** 3 = 3, so the function returns `True`.

If the input is not a cube, the function will return `False`.

Note that we assume the input is always valid, so we don't need to check for invalid input.</s>  ```
def is_cube(a):
    return a ** 3 == a

Explanation:

The function first raises the input `a` to the third power using the `**` operator. This will give us the cube of the input.

Next, we compare the cube of the input `a` with the input `a` itself using the `==` operator. If the two values are equal, then the input `a` is a cube.

Finally, we return a boolean value indicating whether the input `a` is a cube.</s>  Here is a Python function that takes an integer a and returns True if it is a cube:
```
def is_cube(a):
    return a ** 3 == a
```
Explanation:

* The function takes an integer a as input.
* The function uses the ** operator to calculate a ** 3, which is the cube of the input integer.
* The function then compares the result of the calculation with the input integer a using the == operator.
* If the result of the calculation is equal to the input integer a, then the function returns True.
* If the result of the calculation is not equal to the input integer a, then the function returns False.

For example, if the input is 27, the function will calculate 27 ** 3, which is 1728, and compare it to 27. Since 1728 is equal to 27, the function will return True. If the input is 12, the function will calculate 12 ** 3, which is 1728, and compare it to 12. Since 1728 is not equal to 12, the function will return False.</s>  ```

Explanation:

The function `is_cube` takes an integer `a` as input and returns `True` if `a` is a cube.

We can check if `a` is a cube by calculating its cube root using the `**` operator. If the cube root is equal to `a`, then `a` is a cube.

For example, if `a = 6`, then `a ** 3` is equal to `216`, and `6` is a cube. So, the function returns `True`.

On the other hand, if `a = 4`, then `a ** 3` is equal to `64`, and `4` is not a cube. So, the function returns `False`.

Note that we can assume that the input is always valid, and the function does not need to handle any errors.</s>  ```

Explanation:

The function takes an integer `a` as input and returns `True` if `a` is a cube. The algorithm works by raising `a` to the third power and comparing it to `a`. If `a` is a cube, the two numbers will be equal, otherwise they will not.

Explanation:

The function first raises the input integer a to the third power using the `**` operator. This gives us the cube of the input integer.

Next, we compare the cube of the input integer with the original input integer using the `==` operator. If the two values are equal, then the input integer is a cube and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, the function returns `False`.

def is_cube(a):

Explanation:

The function first raises the input integer a to the power of 3 using the ** operator. This produces a cube of the input integer. Then, the function compares the result of the previous operation to the original input integer using the == operator. If the two values are equal, the function returns True, indicating that the input integer is a cube. Otherwise, the function returns False.

The function assumes that the input integer is always valid, meaning that it is non-negative and can be safely raised to the power of 3 without causing an error.</s>  Here's a function that takes an integer `a` and returns `True` if it is a cube:
```
def is_cube(a):
    return a ** 3 == a
```
This function works by raising the number to the power of 3, which will give the cube of the number. Then, it checks if the result is equal to the original number, which is a cube if and only if the number is a cube.

For example, if we call the function with the argument `a = 8`, the function will return `True` because `8 ** 3 == 8`. If we call the function with the argument `a = 9`, the function will return `False` because `9 ** 3 != 9`.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.</s>  ```
def is_cube(a):
    return a ** 3 == a
```
Explanation:

The function takes an integer `a` as input and returns `True` if `a` is a cube, and `False` otherwise.

To determine if `a` is a cube, we can simply check if `a ** 3` (i.e., `a` cubed) is equal to `a`. If `a` is a cube, then `a ** 3` will be equal to `a`.

For example, `2 ** 3 == 2`, `3 ** 3 == 3`, `10 ** 3 == 1000`, and so on.

Therefore, the function returns `True` if `a` is a cube and `False` otherwise.

Note that we can assume the input is always valid, as we have specified that in the problem statement.</s>  ```
def is_cube(a):

Explanation:

The function `is_cube` takes an integer `a` as input and returns `True` if `a` is a cube.

We use the fact that the cube of a number `x` is equal to `x ** 3`. Therefore, if `a` is a cube, `a ** 3` will equal `a`.

We can use the built-in `**` operator to raise `a` to the power of 3 and compare it to `a` to determine if it is a cube.

Note that we assume the input is always valid and do not need to check for negative numbers or other edge cases.</s>  ```

* It calculates `a ** 3`, which is the cube of `a`.
* It compares `a ** 3` to `a`, which returns `True` if they are equal.

In this test suite, we have two property tests:

1. `property_1`: This test takes an integer `a` as input and asserts that the function returns `True` if `a` is a cube.
2. `property_2`: This test takes an integer `a` as input and asserts that the function returns `True` if `a` is not a cube.

Both of these property tests use the `hypothesis` library to generate a random integer `a` and then run the function on that integer. If the function returns `True` or `False` as expected, the test passes. If the test fails, it means that the function is not behaving as expected and we should investigate further.

Note that we are using the `strategies` module to generate random integers. This module provides a wide range of strategies for generating random integers, such as `integers()` which generates random integers in the range of `-1000000000` to `1000000000`. We can also use other strategies such as `integers(min_value=0, max_value=1000)` which generates random integers in the range of `0` to `1000`.</s>  ```

def is_cube(a):
    return a ** 3 == a

Explanation:

* We use the fact that the cube of a number is equal to the number to the third power.
* We check if the input `a` is equal to the cube of itself by comparing `a ** 3` to `a`.
* If the two values are equal, then `a` is a cube.
* If the two values are not equal, then `a` is not a cube.

For example, if we have `a = 8`, then `a ** 3` is equal to `216`, which is not equal to `8`. Therefore, `a` is not a cube.

However, if we have `a = 27`, then `a ** 3` is equal to `1331`, which is equal to `27`. Therefore, `a` is a cube.

Therefore, our function will return `True` if the input is a cube and `False` otherwise.</s>  Here is a function that takes an integer a and returns True if it is a cube:
```
def is_cube(a):

If they are equal, the function returns `True`, indicating that `a` is a cube. Otherwise, the function returns `False`.

Explanation:
The function takes an integer `a` as input and returns `True` if `a` is a cube.

To determine if an integer is a cube, we can simply raise it to the power of 3 and compare it to the original value. If the result is equal, then the integer is a cube.

For example, if we have the integer `a = 27`, we can raise it to the power of 3 to get `27 ** 3 = 1728`, which is equal to the original value of `a`. Therefore, we return `True`.

On the other hand, if we have the integer `a = 12`, we raise it to the power of 3 to get `12 ** 3 = 1728`, which is not equal to the original value of `a`. Therefore, we return `False`.

Note that we can assume that the input is always valid, so we do not need to check for invalid inputs.</s>  ```
def is_cube(a):

Explanation:

The function takes an integer `a` as input and returns `True` if `a` is a cube. We check if `a` is a cube by raising it to the power of 3 and checking if the result is equal to `a`. If the result is not equal to `a`, then `a` is not a cube, so we return `False`.

The time complexity of this function is O(1) because we are only performing a single operation, which is the raising of `a` to the power of 3. The space complexity is also O(1) because we are not using any additional memory to store the result.</s>
