  Here is a test suite for the `is_multiply_prime` function:
```
from hypothesis import given, strategies

def property_test(candidate_function):
    @given(strategies.integers(0, 100))
    def property_1(a):
        assert candidate_function(a) == (a % 3 == 0)

    @given(strategies.integers(0, 100))
    def property_2(a):
        assert candidate_function(a) == (a % 5 == 0)

    return [property_1, property_2]
```
This test suite uses the `hypothesis` library to generate random inputs within the range of 0 to 100 for the `is_multiply_prime` function. It then asserts that the function returns `True` if the input is the multiplication of 3 prime numbers, and `False` otherwise.

The `property_test` function takes a candidate function as an argument and returns a list of property tests for the function. The first property test checks that the function returns `True` if the input is a multiple of 3, and the second property test checks that the function returns `True` if the input is a multiple of 5.

To use this test suite, you can import the `property_test` function and call it with the `is_multiply_prime` function as an argument, like this:
```
from is_multiply_prime import property_test

property_test(is_multiply_prime)
```
This will run the property tests for the `is_multiply_prime` function and report any failures.</s>  def is_multiply_prime(a):

This code uses a simple brute force approach to check if the given number is the multiplication of 3 prime numbers. It checks if the number is less than 100, and if it is not, it returns false immediately. If the number is greater than 100, it iterates over all numbers between 2 and the square root of the number, and checks if the number is divisible by any of these numbers. If it is divisible by any of these numbers, it returns false. If it reaches the end of the loop without finding any divisors, it returns true.

The time complexity of this code is O(sqrt(a)), where a is the given number. This is because the loop iterates over all numbers between 2 and the square root of the number, which is approximately sqrt(a). The space complexity is O(1), because the function does not use any additional memory.</s>  ```

Explanation:

The function first checks if the given number (a) is less than 100. If it is, it immediately returns False, since no number less than 100 can be the multiplication of 3 prime numbers.

If the number is greater than 100, the function iterates through the numbers from 2 to the square root of the number (since the number is the multiplication of 3 prime numbers, it must be divisible by at least 3 prime factors). For each number that is divisible by a, the function returns False, since a is not the multiplication of 3 prime numbers.

Finally, if the function reaches the end of the loop and does not return False, it means that the number is the multiplication of 3 prime numbers and returns True.</s>  ```

            return False
    return True
```
Explanation:

The function first checks if the given number (a) is less than 100, if it is not, it returns False immediately.

Next, it iterates through all the numbers from 2 to the square root of a, and checks if any of them divide a evenly. If any of them do, it returns False.

Finally, if none of the previous conditions are met, it returns True.

This function is efficient because it only checks for divisibility by prime numbers up to the square root of a, which is optimal given the constraints.</s>
