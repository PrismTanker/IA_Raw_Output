Prompt: You'll be given a string of words, and your task is to count the number
    of boredoms. A boredom is a sentence that starts with "I".
-------------------
  Here's a possible test suite for the problem:
```json
{
    "test_boredom_count": {
        "in": {
            "string": "I am bored. I am so bored. I am bored of this sentence."
        },
        "out": 3
    },
    "test_boredom_count_with_punctuation": {
        "in": {
            "string": "I am bored. I am so bored! I am bored of this sentence?"

        "out": 3
    },
    "test_boredom_count_with_newlines": {
        "in": {
            "string": "I am bored.\nI am so bored.\nI am bored of this sentence."

    "test_boredom_count_with_leading_whitespace": {

        "out": 0
    },
    "test_boredom_count_with_no_boredom": {
        "in": {

        "out": 0
    }
}
```
This test suite includes a few different test cases to cover different scenarios, such as strings with punctuation, newlines, leading/trailing whitespace, and empty strings. It also includes a test case with a string that does not contain any boredom to ensure that the function handles that case correctly.</s>  {
    "test1": {
        "in": {
            "string": "I am bored."
        },
        "out": 1
    },
    "test2": {
        "in": {
            "string": "I am bored. I am bored again."
        },
        "out": 2
    },
    "test3": {
        "in": {
            "string": "I am bored. I am bored again. I am bored again."
        },
        "out": 3

        },
        "out": 3
    }
}</s>  Here is a test suite for the given problem:
```
{
    "test1": {
        "in": {
            "string": "I am bored."
        },
        "out": 1
    },
    "test2": {
        "in": {
            "string": "I am bored. I am bored."
        },
        "out": 2
    },
    "test3": {
        "in": {
            "string": "I am bored. I am bored. I am bored."
        },
        "out": 3
    },
    "test4": {
        "in": {
            "string": "I am bored. I am bored. I am bored. I am bored."
        },
        "out": 4
    },
    "test5": {
        "in": {
            "string": "I am bored. I am bored. I am bored. I am bored. I am bored."
        },
        "out": 5
    }
}
```
In this test suite, we have five tests that cover different scenarios. Each test has a string input and an expected output. The input strings are constructed to test different cases, such as a single sentence starting with "I", multiple sentences starting with "I", and a sentence that does not start with "I". The expected output for each test is the number of boredoms in the input string.</s>  ```
import re

def count_boredom(text):
    return len(re.findall(r'^I\b', text, flags=re.MULTILINE))
```
This code uses the `re` module to count the number of lines in the input text that start with "I". The `^` anchor matches the beginning of a line, and the `\b` word boundary ensures that "I" is not part of a larger word. The `re.MULTILINE` flag allows the `^` anchor to match the beginning of each line, rather than just the beginning of the entire input text.</s>  ```
def count_boredoms(sentence):
    count = 0
    for word in sentence.split():
        if word.lower().startswith("i"):
            count += 1
    return count
```</s>  ```
import re

def count_boredom(text):
    return len(re.findall(r"^I ", text, flags=re.MULTILINE))
```
This code uses the `re` module to count the number of occurrences of the pattern `^I ` in the input text. The `^` anchor matches the beginning of a line, and the space character matches a space. The `MULTILINE` flag tells `re.findall` to match the pattern across multiple lines. The length of the resulting list is the number of boredoms.</s>  ```
def count_boredom(text):
    count = 0
    for sentence in text.split("."):
        if sentence.startswith("I"):
            count += 1
    return count
```</s>  
```
def count_boredoms(sentence):
    return sentence.count("I")
```
You can test it by calling the function with a sentence as an argument, like this:
```
print(count_boredoms("I am feeling bored.")) # Should return 1
print(count_boredoms("I am feeling bored. I am feeling bored again.")) # Should return 2
print(count_boredoms("I am feeling bored. I am feeling bored again. I am feeling bored again.")) # Should return 3
```</s>  ```
import re

def count_boredom(text):
    return len(re.findall(r'^I\b', text, flags=re.MULTILINE))
```
This code uses the `re` module to count the number of sentences that start with "I" in the given text. The `r'^I\b'` pattern matches any sentence that starts with "I" at the beginning of a line, and the `flags=re.MULTILINE` argument tells `re.findall` to search for the pattern on each line of the text. The `len` function is used to count the number of matches.</s>  ```
import re

def count_boredom(text):
    return len(re.findall(r"\bI\b", text))
```
Explanation:

The `re` module is used to perform regular expression matching. The regular expression `\bI\b` matches the word "I" as a whole word, i.e., it will not match "I" if it is part of a larger word. The `findall` function returns a list of all the matches, and the length of the list is the number of boredoms.</s>  

```
def count_boredom(input_string):
    return input_string.count("I")
```</s>  ```
import re

def count_boredoms(text):
    return len(re.findall(r'\bI\b', text))
```</s>  ```
def count_boredom(sentence):
    return sentence.count("I")
```
This code uses the `count` method of strings to count the number of occurrences of the letter "I" in the input sentence. The `count` method returns the number of occurrences of the specified substring in the string. In this case, we are counting the number of occurrences of the letter "I" in the sentence.</s>
