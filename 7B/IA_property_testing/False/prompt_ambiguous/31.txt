def property_test(candidate_function):

```
This test suite uses the Hypothesis library to generate random test cases for the input function. The first property test checks if the input function correctly identifies prime numbers, and the second property test checks if the input function correctly identifies composite numbers.

The first property test uses the `strategies.integers()` strategy to generate random integers, and the `candidate_function` is applied to each integer. The output of the `candidate_function` is compared to the expected output using the `assert` statement.

The second property test also uses the `strategies.integers()` strategy to generate random integers, but this time the input is assumed to be even. The input is then divided by 2, and the output of the `candidate_function` is compared to the expected output using the `assert` statement.

The `given` decorator is used to specify the inputs to the property tests. The `strategies.integers()` strategy is used to generate random integers that are used as inputs to the property tests.

Note that this is just a basic example, and you may need to add more test cases or modify the test cases based on the specific requirements of your solution.</s>  def is_prime(n):

This code uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to determine if a number is prime. It starts by iterating from 2 to the square root of the number and checking if the number is divisible by any number in the range. If the number is not divisible by any number in the range, it is prime.

This code uses the `range()` function to generate a range of numbers from 2 to the square root of the number. It then uses a `for` loop to iterate over the range and checks if the number is divisible by any number in the range. If the number is divisible by any number in the range, it is not prime. If the number is not divisible by any number in the range, it is prime.

This code uses the `int()` function to convert the number to an integer, and the `**` operator to calculate the square root of the number.

This code does not use any modules, but it does use the `range()` function which is a built-in function in Python.</s>  ```
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```
This code uses a simple algorithm to check if a number is prime. It iterates from 2 to the square root of the number and checks if the number is divisible by any of the numbers in the range. If the number is not divisible by any of the numbers in the range, it means that the number is prime.

Note that this code uses the `math.sqrt()` function from the `math` module to calculate the square root of a number. If you are using Python 2.x, you can use `pow(n, 0.5)` instead of `math.sqrt(n)`.

Also, this code returns `True` for 0 and 1, which are not prime numbers. If you want to exclude these numbers from being considered prime, you can modify the code to check if the number is greater than 1 before returning `True`.</s>  ```
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```
This code uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to check if a number is prime. It starts by checking if the number is less than 2, and if it is, it immediately returns False. If the number is greater than or equal to 2, it iterates through the numbers 2 to the square root of the number, and for each number it checks if the number is divisible by that number. If the number is divisible by any of the numbers, it returns False. If the number is not divisible by any of the numbers, it returns True.</s>  Here is a Python function that returns True if a number is prime and False otherwise:
```
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```
This function uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to determine if a number is prime. It starts by iterating from 2 to the square root of the number and checks if any of the numbers in the range are factors of the number. If a factor is found, the number is not prime and the function returns False. If no factors are found, the number is prime and the function returns True.

To use this function, you can call it with a number as an argument, like this:
```
print(is_prime(17))  # True
print(is_prime(18))  # False
```</s>  def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```</s>  To determine if a number is prime, you can use the following Python code:
```
def is_prime(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```
This code uses a simple loop to iterate through the numbers from 2 to the square root of the given number, and checks if the number is divisible by any of these numbers. If the number is not divisible by any of these numbers, it is prime.

Here is a brief explanation of how the code works:

1. The function first checks if the input number is less than or equal to 1. If it is, it returns False, as 0 and 1 are not prime numbers.
2. The function then iterates through the numbers from 2 to the square root of the given number (inclusive).
3. For each number in this range, the function checks if the input number is divisible by it. If it is, it returns False, as the number is not prime.
4. If the number is not divisible by any of the numbers in the range, it returns True, indicating that the number is prime.

Note that this code uses the `math.sqrt()` function from the `math` module to calculate the square root of the given number. If you do not want to use this function, you can replace it with the following line of code: `int(n ** 0.5) + 1`. This line of code calculates the square root of the given number and then adds 1 to it, as the `range()` function requires the end value to be exclusive.</s>  Here is a Python function that checks if a number is prime:
```
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```
This function uses a simple loop to check if a number is prime. It starts by checking if the number is less than 2, since all numbers less than 2 are not prime. If the number is greater than or equal to 2, it loops through the numbers 2 to the square root of the number, checking if the number is divisible by any of these numbers. If the number is divisible by any of these numbers, it is not prime, so the function returns False. Otherwise, the function returns True.

To use this function, you can call it with a number as an argument, like this:
```
print(is_prime(17))  # True
print(is_prime(12))  # False
```
This will print True for 17, since 17 is a prime number, and False for 12, since 12 is not a prime number.</s>  ```
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```
This code uses a simple brute-force algorithm to check if a number is prime. It iterates from 2 to the square root of the number and checks if the number is divisible by any of the numbers in that range. If the number is not divisible by any of the numbers in the range, it must be prime.

This code is a good starting point, but there are some optimizations that can be made to make it more efficient. For example, you can start the loop at 3 instead of 2, since 2 and 3 are the only even prime numbers. Additionally, you can use the modulo operator instead of the division operator to check if the number is divisible by a number in the range. This will make the code faster and more efficient.

Here is an optimized version of the code:
```
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 3:
        return False
    for i in range(3, int(n ** 0.5) + 1, 2):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```
This code is more efficient and faster than the previous version, but it is still not the most efficient solution. There are other algorithms that can be used to check if a number is prime, such as the Sieve of Eratosthenes and the Miller-Rabin primality test. These algorithms are more efficient and can be used to check if a number is prime more quickly and accurately.</s>  ```
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```
This function uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to determine if a number is prime. It starts by checking if the number is less than 2, since all numbers less than 2 are not prime. If the number is greater than or equal to 2, it loops through the numbers 2 to the square root of the number, and checks if any of those numbers divide the original number. If a number is found that divides the original number, it returns False, indicating that the number is not prime. If no such number is found, it returns True, indicating that the number is prime.

For example, if we call the function with the argument 11, it will return False, since 11 is not a prime number. If we call the function with the argument 13, it will return True, since 13 is a prime number.</s>  ```
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```
This function uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to determine whether a given number is prime. It starts by checking if the number is less than 2, and if so, it returns False. If the number is greater than or equal to 2, it iterates from 2 to the square root of the number and checks if the number is divisible by any of the numbers in the range. If it is divisible by any number, it returns False, indicating that the number is not prime. Otherwise, it returns True, indicating that the number is prime.</s>
