Prompt: Return list of prime factors of given integer in the order from smallest to largest.
    Each of the factors should be listed number of times corresponding to how many times it appeares in factorization.
    Input number should be equal to the product of all factors

    },
    "out": [
      [2, 2, 3]

    ]
  }
}</s>  Sure, here is a JSON test suite for the problem you described:
```

    "test_prime_factors_1": {
        "in": {
            "n": 12
        },
        "out": [2, 2, 3]
    },
    "test_prime_factors_2": {
        "in": {
            "n": 15

    "test_prime_factors_3": {
        "in": {
            "n": 24

    },
    "test_prime_factors_4": {
        "in": {

        },
        "out": [2, 2, 5, 5]
    }
}
```
This test suite includes four tests, each of which tests a different input value for the `n` parameter. The `out` parameter contains the expected output for each test case. The `in` parameter contains the input value for the `n` parameter.

Note that the output for each test case is a list of prime factors of the input value in the order from smallest to largest. Each prime factor is listed number of times corresponding to how many times it appears in the factorization.</s>  ```
def prime_factors(n):
    factors = []
    i = 2
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i:
            i += 1
        else:
            n //= i
            factors.append(i)
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)
    return factors
```
This function uses a simple algorithm to factorize the input integer `n`. It starts by setting the factor `i` to 2 and repeatedly increments `i` by 1 until it finds a factor of `n`. If `n` is not divisible by `i`, it sets `n` to the result of `n // i` (integer division) and appends `i` to the list of factors. If `n` is divisible by `i`, it sets `n` to the result of `n // i` and appends `i` to the list of factors. If `n` is 1, it returns the list of factors.

For example, if `n` is equal to 120, the function will return `[2, 2, 3, 5, 5]`, which is the list of prime factors of 120 in the order from smallest to largest.</s>
