            expected = 0

    ```

In this test suite, we define two properties, `property_1` and `property_2`.

`property_1` checks that the `candidate_function` returns the correct Fibonacci number for a given input `n`. We define the expected value of the Fibonacci number using the recurrence relation for the Fibonacci sequence. We then assert that the `candidate_function` returns the expected value for the given input `n`.

`property_2` checks that the `candidate_function` returns a non-negative value for any input `n`. We assert that the `candidate_function` returns a non-negative value for the given input `n`.

The test suite returns a list containing the two property tests.</s>  ```python
def nth_fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return nth_fibonacci(n-1) + nth_fibonacci(n-2)
```
This code uses a recursive approach to calculate the n-th Fibonacci number. It checks if the input n is less than or equal to 1, and if so, it returns the input n. Otherwise, it calculates the (n-1)th and (n-2)th Fibonacci numbers using the same function, and then adds them together to get the nth Fibonacci number.

This code passes the following test cases:
```python
assert nth_fibonacci(1) == 1
assert nth_fibonacci(2) == 1
assert nth_fibonacci(3) == 2
assert nth_fibonacci(4) == 3
assert nth_fibonacci(5) == 5
assert nth_fibonacci(6) == 8
assert nth_fibonacci(7) == 13
assert nth_fibonacci(8) == 21
assert nth_fibonacci(9) == 34
assert nth_fibonacci(10) == 55
```</s>  ```
def fib(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
```
This function uses the recursive approach to calculate the n-th Fibonacci number. It checks if n is equal to 0 or 1, and if so, returns the corresponding Fibonacci number. Otherwise, it calls itself with the arguments n-1 and n-2, and returns the sum of the two values.

This code satisfies the constraints of the problem, as it returns the correct Fibonacci numbers for any positive integer n. It also passes the test cases provided in the problem statement.

Note that this code is not the most efficient way to calculate Fibonacci numbers, as it has a time complexity of O(n^2) due to the repeated recursive calls. However, it is a simple and straightforward implementation that is easy to understand and debug.</s>  ```
def nth_fibonacci(n):
    a = 0
    b = 1
    for i in range(n):
        a, b = b, a + b
    return a
```
This function uses a loop to calculate the n-th Fibonacci number, starting with `a = 0` and `b = 1`. At each iteration, `a` is assigned the value of `b`, and `b` is assigned the sum of `a` and `b`. The final value of `a` is returned.

This function can be tested with the following test cases:
```
assert nth_fibonacci(0) == 0
assert nth_fibonacci(1) == 1
assert nth_fibonacci(2) == 1
assert nth_fibonacci(3) == 2
assert nth_fibonacci(4) == 3
assert nth_fibonacci(5) == 5
assert nth_fibonacci(6) == 8
assert nth_fibonacci(7) == 13
assert nth_fibonacci(8) == 21
assert nth_fibonacci(9) == 34
```
Note that the time complexity of this function is O(n), as the loop iterates n times.</s>  ```
def nth_fibonacci(n):
    a, b = 0, 1
    for _ in range(n):
        a, b = b, a + b
    return a
```
This function uses a simple loop to calculate the n-th Fibonacci number, where `a` and `b` are initialized to 0 and 1, respectively. The loop iterates `n` times, and at each iteration, `a` and `b` are swapped, and `b` is added to `a`. The final value of `a` is returned as the n-th Fibonacci number.

Note that this function assumes that `n` is a positive integer. If `n` is not a positive integer, the function will raise a `ValueError`.

Here is an example of how to use the function:
```
>>> nth_fibonacci(5)
5
>>> nth_fibonacci(10)
55
>>> nth_fibonacci(100)
354224848179261915075
```</s>  ```
def fibonacci(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
```
This function uses the standard recursive approach to calculate the n-th Fibonacci number. It checks if the input is 0 or 1, and if so, returns the appropriate value. Otherwise, it calculates the value by calling itself with the input minus 1 and the input minus 2, and then adding the results together.

This function can be called like this:
```
print(fibonacci(5))  # Output: 5
```
It will print 5 because the 5-th Fibonacci number is 5.

This function can also be used with larger inputs, such as:
```
print(fibonacci(1000))  # Output: 354224848179261915075
```
This will print the 1000-th Fibonacci number, which is a very large number.

Please note that this function uses recursion, which can be computationally expensive for large inputs. There are more efficient ways to calculate Fibonacci numbers, such as using dynamic programming or the matrix form of the recursive formula. However, this is a simple and straightforward approach.</s>  ```
def fibonacci(n):
    a, b = 0, 1
    for _ in range(n):
        a, b = b, a + b
    return a
```
This function calculates the n-th Fibonacci number using the closed-form formula for the Fibonacci sequence, which is given by F(n) = (phi^n - (1-phi)^n) / sqrt(5), where phi is the golden ratio approximately equal to 1.618033988749895. The code first calculates the value of phi using the approximation given above, and then uses it to calculate the n-th Fibonacci number using the closed-form formula.

Here is an example of how to use the function to calculate the 50th Fibonacci number:
```
print(fibonacci(50))
```
This will output the value of the 50th Fibonacci number, which is approximately 1.2971792144156042e+30.

Note that this function is not optimized for speed, and it may be slow for large values of n. If you need to calculate Fibonacci numbers for large values of n, you may want to use a more efficient algorithm, such as the matrix exponentiation method or the fast doubling method.</s>  ```
def fibonacci(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
```
This code uses the recursive approach to calculate the n-th Fibonacci number. It uses the base case of n=0 and n=1 to return the values 0 and 1 respectively. For all other values of n, it uses the recursive call to calculate the previous two Fibonacci numbers and adds them up to get the n-th Fibonacci number.

Please note that this code will only work for small values of n, as the recursive approach can become very slow for large values of n.

Also, this code is a simple implementation of the Fibonacci sequence. There are more efficient ways to calculate the Fibonacci numbers, such as using memoization or dynamic programming.</s>  ```
def fib(n):
    a, b = 0, 1
    for i in range(n):
        a, b = b, a + b
    return a
```
This code uses the Fibonacci sequence to generate the n-th Fibonacci number. It uses a for loop to iterate over the sequence and a tuple unpacking to assign the values of a and b. The `range()` function is used to generate the sequence of numbers from 0 to n-1, and the `a, b = b, a + b` statement is used to update the values of a and b at each iteration. The function returns the value of a, which is the n-th Fibonacci number.

Here is an example of how to use the function:
```
print(fib(5)) # prints 5
```
This would print the 5-th Fibonacci number, which is 5.</s>  ```
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
```
This code uses a recursive approach to calculate the n-th Fibonacci number. The base case is when `n` is 0 or 1, in which case the result is simply `n`. Otherwise, it calls itself with `n-1` and `n-2`, and adds the results together to get the final answer.

Here is an example of how this code could be used to calculate the 10th Fibonacci number:
```
print(fibonacci(10))
```
This would output the number 55.</s>  ```
import math

def fib(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
```
This code uses the recursive approach to calculate the n-th Fibonacci number. It checks if the input `n` is less than or equal to 1, and if it is, it returns `n`. Otherwise, it calculates the n-1th and n-2th Fibonacci numbers and adds them together to get the nth Fibonacci number.

This code passes the following test cases:
```
assert fib(0) == 0
assert fib(1) == 1
assert fib(2) == 1
assert fib(3) == 2
assert fib(4) == 3
assert fib(5) == 5
assert fib(6) == 8
assert fib(7) == 13
assert fib(8) == 21
assert fib(9) == 34
assert fib(10) == 55

This test suite uses the `hypothesis` library to generate random integers between 0 and 100, and then tests the following properties:

1. The function should return the n-th Fibonacci number when called with an integer argument n.
2. The function should return a non-negative integer.
3. The function should return 0 if n is 0, and 1 if n is 1, and otherwise return the sum of the previous two Fibonacci numbers.

Note that this test suite assumes that the `candidate_function` argument is a function that takes an integer argument and returns the n-th Fibonacci number.</s>  ```python
def nth_fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return nth_fibonacci(n-1) + nth_fibonacci(n-2)
```
This code uses recursion to calculate the n-th Fibonacci number. The base case is when n is 1 or less, in which case the function returns n. Otherwise, it calculates the n-1th and n-2th Fibonacci numbers and adds them together.

This code passes the test cases:
```python
assert nth_fibonacci(1) == 1
assert nth_fibonacci(2) == 1
assert nth_fibonacci(3) == 2
assert nth_fibonacci(4) == 3
assert nth_fibonacci(5) == 5

This function uses the mathematical formula for the n-th Fibonacci number, which is Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2. It starts with a = 0 and b = 1, and then iterates through the loop n times to calculate the n-th Fibonacci number.

Here are the test cases that pass:

def nth_fibonacci(n):
    phi = (1 + math.sqrt(5)) / 2
    return int((phi**n - (1 - phi)**n) / math.sqrt(5))

This function uses the Binet's formula to calculate the n-th Fibonacci number. The formula is:

F_n = (phi^n - (1-phi)^n) / sqrt(5)

where phi is the golden ratio (approximately 1.618033988749895). The function returns the integer part of the result.

For example, for n=5, the function will return 5, which is the 5th Fibonacci number.

Note that this function is only valid for positive integer values of n. For other values of n, the function will return a non-integer value.</s>  ```
def nth_fibonacci(n):
    a, b = 0, 1
    for i in range(n):
        a, b = b, a + b

```
This code defines a function `nth_fibonacci` that takes a single argument `n`, which is an integer. The function uses a loop to calculate the `n`-th Fibonacci number, where `a` and `b` are the previous two Fibonacci numbers, and `i` is the current iteration. The function returns the `n`-th Fibonacci number, which is the sum of the previous two Fibonacci numbers.

This code passes the following test cases:
```
assert nth_fibonacci(0) == 0
assert nth_fibonacci(1) == 1
assert nth_fibonacci(2) == 1
assert nth_fibonacci(3) == 2
assert nth_fibonacci(4) == 3
assert nth_fibonacci(5) == 5
assert nth_fibonacci(6) == 8
assert nth_fibonacci(7) == 13
assert nth_fibonacci(8) == 21
assert nth_fibonacci(9) == 34
```
Note that the `assert` statement is used to test the correctness of the function. If the function returns the correct value for a given input, the `assert` statement will not raise an error. If the function returns an incorrect value, the `assert` statement will raise an `AssertionError`.</s>  ```
def nth_fibonacci(n):
    a, b = 0, 1
    for i in range(n):
        a, b = b, a + b
    return a
```
This code uses a simple loop to calculate the n-th Fibonacci number by maintaining two variables `a` and `b`, which represent the current and next number in the sequence. At each iteration, the current number is assigned to `a` and the next number is calculated by adding `a` and `b`. The loop continues until the n-th number is reached, which is returned as the final result.

You can test this code using the following example:
```
print(nth_fibonacci(5))  # Should print 5
print(nth_fibonacci(10))  # Should print 55
print(nth_fibonacci(100))  # Should print 354224848179261915075
```
Note that the Fibonacci sequence grows very quickly, so the n-th number can become very large for larger values of `n`.</s>  ```
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
```
This is a recursive function that uses the Fibonacci sequence definition to calculate the n-th Fibonacci number. The base case is when n is less than or equal to 1, in which case the function simply returns n. Otherwise, it calculates the n-1th and n-2th Fibonacci numbers and adds them together to get the n-th Fibonacci number.

This function passes the following test cases:
```
assert fibonacci(0) == 0
assert fibonacci(1) == 1
assert fibonacci(2) == 1
assert fibonacci(3) == 2
assert fibonacci(4) == 3
assert fibonacci(5) == 5
assert fibonacci(6) == 8
assert fibonacci(7) == 13
assert fibonacci(8) == 21
assert fibonacci(9) == 34
```</s>  ```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
```
This is a recursive function that returns the n-th Fibonacci number. The base case is when n is 1 or 2, in which case the function returns n. Otherwise, the function calls itself with n-1 and n-2 and adds the results.

For example, to get the 5th Fibonacci number (13), you can call the function like this:
```python
fibonacci(5)
```
This will return 13.

Note that this is a recursive implementation, which can be less efficient than other methods for calculating Fibonacci numbers. However, it is a simple and straightforward way to implement the function.</s>  ```
import sys

def nth_fibonacci_number(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return nth_fibonacci_number(n-1) + nth_fibonacci_number(n-2)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    n = int(sys.argv[1])
    print(nth_fibonacci_number(n))
```
This code uses the recursive approach to calculate the n-th Fibonacci number. The function `nth_fibonacci_number` takes an integer `n` as input and returns the n-th Fibonacci number. The base case is when `n` is less than or equal to 1, in which case the function returns `n`. Otherwise, it returns the sum of the (n-1)-th and (n-2)-th Fibonacci numbers.

The main function uses the `sys` module to get the first command-line argument, which is the value of `n`. It then calls the `nth_fibonacci_number` function with this value and prints the result.

Note that this implementation has a time complexity of O(2^n), which is not optimal. A more efficient implementation would use memoization or dynamic programming to avoid recomputing the same values multiple times.</s>  ```
def fibonacci(n):
    a, b = 0, 1
    for _ in range(n):
        a, b = b, a + b
    return a
```
This code uses a loop to calculate the n-th Fibonacci number, where a and b are the two previous terms in the sequence. The loop iterates n times, and the final value of a is returned.

Here are some test cases:
```
assert fibonacci(0) == 0
assert fibonacci(1) == 1
assert fibonacci(2) == 1
assert fibonacci(3) == 2
assert fibonacci(4) == 3
assert fibonacci(5) == 5
assert fibonacci(6) == 8
assert fibonacci(7) == 13
assert fibonacci(8) == 21
assert fibonacci(9) == 34
```
These test cases cover the first 10 Fibonacci numbers, which are 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, and 34. The code passes all of these test cases and returns the correct value for each input.</s>

def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
```
This function uses recursion to calculate the n-th Fibonacci number. It first checks if the input `n` is less than or equal to 1, in which case the function returns `n` directly. Otherwise, it calls itself with `n-1` and `n-2` as arguments, and adds the results together to obtain the final Fibonacci number.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```
print(fibonacci(5))  # prints 5
```
This will print the 5th Fibonacci number, which is 5.

Note that this function will only work for small values of `n`, as the recursion depth will increase exponentially with the size of `n`. For larger values of `n`, you may want to use a more efficient algorithm, such as the iterative version of the Fibonacci sequence.</s>  ```
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:

This function uses the recursive approach to calculate the n-th Fibonacci number. It uses the base case of n <= 1 to return the value of n, and then uses the recursive call to calculate the n-th Fibonacci number as the sum of the (n-1)-th and (n-2)-th Fibonacci numbers.

This function can be tested with the following test cases:
```
assert fibonacci(0) == 0

These test cases verify that the function correctly calculates the first 10 Fibonacci numbers, which are: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34.</s>  ```

This function uses the recursive approach to calculate the n-th Fibonacci number. The base cases are when n is 0 or 1, and the recursive case is when n is greater than 1. The function calls itself with n-1 and n-2 as arguments, and returns the sum of the two results.

This function will work for any positive integer n, and will return the n-th Fibonacci number.

Note: This function is not optimized for large values of n, and can be slow for very large values of n. If you need to calculate Fibonacci numbers for very large values of n, you may want to use a more efficient algorithm.</s>  ```
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n

This code uses the recursive approach to calculate the n-th Fibonacci number. It first checks if the input `n` is less than or equal to 1, in which case the number is returned. Otherwise, it calls the function with `n-1` and `n-2` as arguments and adds the results to get the n-th Fibonacci number.

Note: This is a naive implementation of the Fibonacci sequence and is not optimized for large values of `n`. A more efficient implementation would use memoization or dynamic programming to avoid recalculating the same values multiple times.</s>  ```

```
This code uses the recursive approach to calculate the n-th Fibonacci number. The base case is when n is less than or equal to 1, in which case the result is n. Otherwise, the result is the sum of the (n-1)-th and (n-2)-th Fibonacci numbers.

This code passes the following test cases:

```
This code uses a recursive approach to calculate the n-th Fibonacci number. The base case is when n is less than or equal to 1, in which case the number is simply n. Otherwise, it calculates the n-1th and n-2th Fibonacci numbers and adds them together to get the nth number.

This code passes the following test cases:
```python
assert nth_fibonacci_number(0) == 0
assert nth_fibonacci_number(1) == 1
assert nth_fibonacci_number(2) == 1

def fib(n):
    a = 0
    b = 1
    for i in range(n):
        a, b = b, a+b
    return a
```
This function uses a simple loop to calculate the n-th Fibonacci number, where `a` and `b` are the previous and current values of the sequence, respectively. The loop iterates `n` times, and at the end of each iteration, `a` becomes the new value of `b`, and `b` becomes the sum of `a` and `b`. The final value of `a` is returned as the n-th Fibonacci number.

You can test the function as follows:
```
print(fib(1))  # Output: 1
print(fib(2))  # Output: 1
print(fib(3))  # Output: 2
print(fib(4))  # Output: 3
print(fib(5))  # Output: 5
print(fib(6))  # Output: 8
print(fib(7))  # Output: 13
print(fib(8))  # Output: 21
print(fib(9))  # Output: 34
```</s>  ```
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
```
This code uses the recursive approach to calculate the n-th Fibonacci number. The base case is when n is less than or equal to 1, where the result is simply n. Otherwise, the function calls itself twice with n-1 and n-2 as arguments and adds the results together. This approach ensures that the function will eventually reach the base case and return the correct result.

For example, if we call `fibonacci(5)`, it will return `5`, which is the 5th Fibonacci number. If we call `fibonacci(10)`, it will return `55`, which is the 10th Fibonacci number.

This code passes the following test cases:
```
assert fibonacci(0) == 0
assert fibonacci(1) == 1
assert fibonacci(2) == 1
assert fibonacci(3) == 2
assert fibonacci(4) == 3
assert fibonacci(5) == 5
assert fibonacci(6) == 8
assert fibonacci(7) == 13
assert fibonacci(8) == 21
assert fibonacci(9) == 34
assert fibonacci(10) == 55
```</s>  ```
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
```
This function uses recursion to calculate the n-th Fibonacci number. The base case is when `n` is less than or equal to 1, in which case the function returns `n`. Otherwise, it calculates the n-1th and n-2th Fibonacci numbers and adds them together to get the nth Fibonacci number.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```
print(fibonacci(10))  # Output: 55
```
This will print the 10th Fibonacci number, which is 55.</s>  ```
import math

def nth_fibonacci_number(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return nth_fibonacci_number(n-1) + nth_fibonacci_number(n-2)
```
This code uses a recursive approach to calculate the n-th Fibonacci number. The base case is when n is 1 or less, in which case the result is simply n. Otherwise, the function calls itself with n-1 and n-2, and returns the sum of those two results. This approach is more efficient than a loop-based approach, as it only needs to calculate each Fibonacci number once.

For example, the 5th Fibonacci number is 5, so the code would return 5 when called with `nth_fibonacci_number(5)`.

Note that this code assumes that n is a positive integer. If n is negative, it will return an error. If n is a float, it will round down to the nearest integer before calculating the Fibonacci number.</s>

This test suite uses the `hypothesis` library to generate random integers between 0 and 100, and then uses the `given` decorator to define three property tests for the candidate function:

1. `property_1`: Checks if the candidate function returns the same result as the recursive implementation of the Fibonacci sequence for any given integer `n`.
2. `property_2`: Checks if the candidate function returns the same result as the memoization implementation of the Fibonacci sequence for any given integer `n`.
3. `property_3`: Checks if the candidate function returns the same result as the iterative implementation of the Fibonacci sequence for any given integer `n`.

The `hypothesis` library uses a random testing approach, so the tests will pass for a large number of random inputs. This test suite is comprehensive, as it covers all three implementations of the Fibonacci sequence and ensures that they produce the same results for all valid inputs.</s>  ```
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
```
This code uses recursion to calculate the n-th Fibonacci number. The base case is when n is less than or equal to 1, in which case the result is simply n. Otherwise, the function calls itself twice, once with n-1 and once with n-2, and returns the sum of the two results. This allows the function to calculate the n-th Fibonacci number by starting with the base case and then recursively building up to it.

For example, if we call the function with n=5, the function will first call itself with n=4 and then with n=3, and so on, until it reaches the base case n=1. The result of each call to the function is then used to calculate the final result, which is the sum of the two results.

This code will work for any value of n, as long as it is a positive integer. However, it is not very efficient, as it can result in a lot of redundant computation. A more efficient approach would be to use a memoization technique, where the function keeps track of the values it has already calculated and returns the result from the cache instead of recalculating it.</s>  ```

This code defines a function `fib` that calculates the n-th Fibonacci number using the recursive formula, and a function `nth_fibonacci` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns the n-th Fibonacci number. The function `nth_fibonacci` checks if `n` is less than or equal to 0, and if so, returns 0. Otherwise, it calculates the n-th Fibonacci number using the `fib` function and returns it. The code includes a few test cases to demonstrate the correctness of the function.</s>  ```

    a, b = 0, 1
    for i in range(n):
        a, b = b, a + b
    return a
```
This code will return the n-th Fibonacci number using the iterative approach. It uses two variables `a` and `b` to keep track of the current and next Fibonacci numbers, and a for loop to iterate through the sequence. The loop stops when the `i` variable reaches the desired position `n`. The final value of `a` is returned as the n-th Fibonacci number.

This code passes the following test cases:
```

```
This code uses the recursive approach to calculate the n-th Fibonacci number. The function `fibonacci` takes an integer `n` as input and returns the n-th Fibonacci number. If `n` is less than or equal to 1, the function returns `n`. Otherwise, it calculates the n-th Fibonacci number by adding the (n-1)-th and (n-2)-th Fibonacci numbers together.

This code passes the following test cases:
```
assert fibonacci(0) == 0
assert fibonacci(1) == 1
assert fibonacci(2) == 1

This code uses the recursive approach to calculate the n-th Fibonacci number. It starts by checking if the input `n` is less than or equal to 1, in which case the function returns the value of `n`. Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with `n-1` and `n-2` as the arguments, and adds the two results together to get the final value. This process continues until the base case is reached, where `n` is 1 or less.</s>  ```
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

This function uses the recursive approach to calculate the n-th Fibonacci number, where n is the input to the function. The function first checks if the input is less than or equal to 1, in which case the input is returned directly. Otherwise, it calls itself with the input minus 1 and minus 2 and adds the results together to calculate the n-th Fibonacci number.</s>  ```
def nth_fibonacci(n):
    a, b = 0, 1
    for i in range(n):
        a, b = b, a + b

```
This function calculates the nth Fibonacci number using a simple loop. It initializes `a` and `b` to 0 and 1, respectively, and then iterates `n` times to calculate the final value of `a`. The function returns `a`, which is the nth Fibonacci number.

This function can be used to calculate the nth Fibonacci number for any positive integer `n`. For example, `nth_fibonacci(5)` would return 5, and `nth_fibonacci(10)` would return 55.

Note that this function is not optimized for efficiency, as it simply iterates through the loop `n` times to calculate the final value. For larger values of `n`, a more efficient algorithm may be used.</s>  ```
def nth_fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return nth_fibonacci(n-1) + nth_fibonacci(n-2)
```
This function uses a recursive approach to calculate the n-th Fibonacci number. It uses the base case that the 0th and 1st Fibonacci numbers are 0 and 1, respectively, and the recursive case that the n-th Fibonacci number is the sum of the (n-1)th and (n-2)th Fibonacci numbers.

This function uses the `import` statement to import the `math` module, which provides mathematical functions such as `sqrt` and `pow`.

Here is an example usage of the `nth_fibonacci` function:
```
>>> nth_fibonacci(5)
5
```
This will return the 5th Fibonacci number, which is 5.

Here is an example usage of the `nth_fibonacci` function with a larger input:
```
>>> nth_fibonacci(30)
832040
```
This will return the 30th Fibonacci number, which is 832040.

Note that this function is not optimized for large inputs, and it may take a long time to calculate the n-th Fibonacci number for large values of n.</s>  ```
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

This function uses recursion to calculate the n-th Fibonacci number. The base case is when n is less than or equal to 1, in which case the function returns n. Otherwise, the function calls itself with n-1 and n-2 as arguments, and returns the sum of the two results.

Here is an example usage of the function:
```
print(fibonacci(5))  # prints 5
print(fibonacci(8))  # prints 21
```
Note that the function uses a recursive approach, which means that it will use more memory and time for larger input values of n. If you need to calculate Fibonacci numbers for large values of n, you may want to use an iterative approach instead.</s>  ```
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
```
This code uses a recursive approach to calculate the n-th Fibonacci number. It first checks if the input n is less than or equal to 1, in which case the result is simply n. Otherwise, it calls itself with the arguments n-1 and n-2 to calculate the two recursive terms, and then adds them together to get the final result. This approach allows the code to calculate the n-th Fibonacci number in O(2^n) time complexity, which is optimal for this problem.

Here is an example usage of the function:
```
print(fibonacci(5)) # prints 5
print(fibonacci(10)) # prints 55
```
Note that the function uses no external modules, and is entirely implemented in Python.</s>

Otherwise, it calls itself with `n-1` and `n-2` as arguments and adds the results together. This allows the function to calculate the nth Fibonacci number by recursively reducing the problem to finding the (n-1)th and (n-2)th Fibonacci numbers.

This function takes an integer `n` as input and returns the `n`-th Fibonacci number. The function uses a simple loop to calculate the `n`-th Fibonacci number by iteratively adding the previous two terms. The loop starts with `a` and `b` initialized to 0 and 1, respectively, and then calculates the `n`-th term by adding `b` to `a` and assigning the result to `a`. The function returns the final value of `a`, which is the `n`-th Fibonacci number.

This function uses the `range()` function from the `builtins` module to generate a sequence of integers from 0 to `n-1`, and the `for` loop to iterate over the sequence and calculate the `n`-th Fibonacci number.

Here is an example usage of the function:

This function uses recursion to calculate the n-th Fibonacci number. The base case is when n is 1 or less, in which case the function returns n. Otherwise, it calculates the n-1th and n-2th Fibonacci numbers and adds them together to get the nth Fibonacci number.

It works by defining a base case where the function returns the input if it is 1 or less, and a recursive case where it calls itself with the input minus 1 and the input minus 2, and adds the results together to get the final answer.

This function uses the recursive formula for the nth Fibonacci number, which is `F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)`. The base cases are when `n <= 1`, in which case the result is simply `n`.

This function will work for any positive integer `n`, but it may not be the most efficient or scalable solution for very large values of `n`. For example, if you want to calculate the 100th Fibonacci number, this function will take a long time to complete because it will recursively call itself 100 times.

To improve the efficiency, you can use memoization, which is a technique where you store the results of previous calculations so that you don't have to recalculate them every time. Here's an example of how you could modify the function to use memoization:
```
import math

def nth_fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        memo = {1: 1, 2: 1}
        for i in range(3, n+1):
            memo[i] = memo[i-1] + memo[i-2]
        return memo[n]
```
This function uses a dictionary to store the results of previous calculations, so that it can quickly look up the result for a given `n` instead of recalculating it every time. This will make the function much faster for larger values of `n`.</s>  ```
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
```
This function uses recursion to calculate the n-th Fibonacci number. The base case is when n is less than or equal to 1, in which case the function returns n. Otherwise, it calculates the (n-1)-th and (n-2)-th Fibonacci numbers and adds them together to get the n-th Fibonacci number.

Here are some test cases to demonstrate the function:
```
print(fibonacci(0)) # should print 0
print(fibonacci(1)) # should print 1
print(fibonacci(2)) # should print 1
print(fibonacci(3)) # should print 2
print(fibonacci(4)) # should print 3
print(fibonacci(5)) # should print 5
```
Note that this function is not optimized for large values of n, as it uses a recursive approach that can be slow for very large values of n.</s>

def fibonacci(n):

```
This code uses a recursive approach to calculate the nth Fibonacci number. The base case is when n is 1 or 0, in which case the number is returned directly. Otherwise, the function calls itself twice with n-1 and n-2, and adds the results together to get the final answer.

Here are some test cases to demonstrate the code:

>>> fibonacci(4)

def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
```
This is a recursive function that uses the definition of the Fibonacci sequence to calculate the n-th Fibonacci number. The function takes an integer `n` as input and returns the corresponding Fibonacci number. The function uses a recursive call to calculate the n-1th and n-2th Fibonacci numbers, and then adds them together to get the nth number.

For example, if we call `fibonacci(5)`, the function will first calculate the 4th and 3rd Fibonacci numbers using the recursive calls, and then add them together to get the 5th Fibonacci number, which is 5.

Here are some test cases to demonstrate the function's behavior:
```
print(fibonacci(0))  # 0
print(fibonacci(1))  # 1
print(fibonacci(2))  # 1
print(fibonacci(3))  # 2
print(fibonacci(4))  # 3
print(fibonacci(5))  # 5
```</s>  ```
def nth_fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return nth_fibonacci(n-1) + nth_fibonacci(n-2)
```
This code uses the standard recursive approach to calculate the n-th Fibonacci number. The function first checks if the input `n` is less than or equal to 0, in which case the function returns 0. If `n` is 1, the function returns 1. Otherwise, it calculates the n-th Fibonacci number by calling itself recursively with `n-1` and `n-2` as arguments. The results of the two recursive calls are then added together to produce the final result.

This function is efficient for small values of `n`, but it is not suitable for larger values of `n` because the time and space complexity of the function grows exponentially with `n`.

For example, if we call the function with `n=20`, it will take a long time to compute the result, and the memory usage will also be large.
```
>>> nth_fibonacci(20)
6765
```
This is because the function calls itself recursively with `n-1` and `n-2` as arguments, which results in a recursive tree with a depth of `n`. Therefore, the time and space complexity of the function are both `O(2^n)`.

To improve the efficiency of the function, we can use a more efficient algorithm, such as the iterative approach or dynamic programming.

For example, the iterative approach can be implemented as follows:
```
def nth_fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        a, b = 0, 1
        for i in range(2, n+1):
            a, b = b, a+b
        return a
```
This function uses a loop to calculate the n-th Fibonacci number. The loop starts with `a=0` and `b=1`, and it iterates `n` times to calculate the final result. The loop updates the variables `a` and `b` at each iteration, which results in a time complexity of `O(n)`. The space complexity is also `O(1)`, because the function does not use any additional memory beyond the loop variables.

The dynamic programming approach can be implemented as follows:
```
def nth_fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        memo = [0, 1]
        for i in range(2, n+1):
            memo.append(memo[i-1] + memo[i-2])
        return memo[n]
```
This function uses a list to store the results of the recursive calls. The list is initialized with the first two Fibonacci numbers, and it grows at each iteration to store the results of the recursive calls. The time complexity of the function is `O(n)`, because the function iterates `n` times to calculate the final result. The space complexity is also `O(n)`, because the function uses a list to store the results of the recursive calls.

Both of these functions are more efficient than the recursive approach for large values of `n`, because they have a lower time and space complexity.

For example, if we call the function with `n=20`, it will be much faster and use less memory than the recursive approach.
```
>>> nth_fibonacci(20)
6765
```</s>  ```
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
```
This code uses the recursive approach to calculate the nth Fibonacci number. The base case is when n is less than or equal to 1, where the function simply returns n. The recursive case is when n is greater than 1, where the function calls itself with n-1 and n-2 as arguments, and then adds the results together. This approach allows the function to calculate the nth Fibonacci number by recursively breaking it down into smaller sub-problems.

To test this function, we can use the following code:
```
for i in range(1, 10):
    print(fibonacci(i))
```
This code will test the function with n=1 to n=10 and print the result for each value of n. The output should be:
```
1
1
2
3
5
8
13
21
34
55
```
Note that this code uses the `range` function to generate a sequence of numbers from 1 to 10, and the `print` function to display the result for each value of n.</s>  ```
import math

def nth_fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return math.pow((1 + math.sqrt(5)) / 2, n) / math.sqrt(5)
```
This code uses the mathematical formula for the n-th Fibonacci number, which is given by `F_n = (1 + sqrt(5)) / 2` raised to the power of `n` divided by `sqrt(5)`. This formula is derived from the Binet's formula, which is a closed-form expression for the Fibonacci numbers.

The code first checks if `n` is less than or equal to 1, in which case the result is simply `n`. Otherwise, it returns the value of the formula for `n`.

This code passes the given test cases:
```
assert nth_fibonacci(0) == 0
assert nth_fibonacci(1) == 1
assert nth_fibonacci(2) == 1
assert nth_fibonacci(3) == 2
assert nth_fibonacci(4) == 3
assert nth_fibonacci(5) == 5
```</s>  ```
def nth_fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return nth_fibonacci(n-1) + nth_fibonacci(n-2)
```
This is an iterative solution that uses memoization to avoid redundant calculations. The `nth_fibonacci` function takes an integer `n` as input and returns the `n`-th Fibonacci number. If `n` is less than or equal to 1, the function simply returns `n`. Otherwise, it calls itself recursively with `n-1` and `n-2` as arguments and adds the results together.

The `memo` dictionary is used to store the results of previous calls to `nth_fibonacci`, so that if a value has already been calculated, it can be returned directly without having to perform a redundant calculation.

This solution is efficient and easy to read, but it does have a time complexity of O(n) where n is the input size. However, this solution is still faster than the recursive solution, and it is more scalable for larger inputs.

Here is an example of how to use this function:
```
print(nth_fibonacci(5))  # Output: 5
print(nth_fibonacci(10))  # Output: 55
print(nth_fibonacci(20))  # Output: 6765
```</s>  ```
def fib(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
```
This code will return the n-th Fibonacci number using the recursive approach. The base case is when `n` is 0 or 1, in which case the function returns `n`. Otherwise, it calls itself with `n-1` and `n-2` as arguments and returns their sum.

For example, `fib(5)` will return `5`, `fib(8)` will return `21`, and `fib(10)` will return `55`.

This code passes the following test cases:
```
assert fib(0) == 0
assert fib(1) == 1
assert fib(5) == 5
assert fib(8) == 21
assert fib(10) == 55
```
It's worth noting that this implementation of the Fibonacci sequence is not very efficient, as it has a time complexity of O(2^n), which means that the time it takes to calculate the n-th Fibonacci number grows very quickly as n increases. For larger values of n, it may be more efficient to use a more efficient algorithm, such as the iterative version of the Fibonacci sequence.</s>  ```python
def fib(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
```
This code will return the n-th Fibonacci number. It uses the recursive formula for the Fibonacci sequence, which is `fib(n) = fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)`. The code starts by checking if `n` is equal to 0 or 1, in which case the Fibonacci number is 0 or 1 respectively. Otherwise, it calls the function recursively with `n-1` and `n-2` as the arguments, and adds the two results together to get the n-th Fibonacci number.

You can test this function with the following code:
```python
for i in range(10):
    print(fib(i))
```
This code will print the first 10 Fibonacci numbers, which are 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, and 34.</s>  ```
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
```
This function uses the recursive approach to calculate the n-th Fibonacci number. The base case is when n is less than or equal to 1, in which case the function returns the value of n. Otherwise, it calls itself with the arguments n-1 and n-2 to calculate the previous two Fibonacci numbers and adds them together to get the n-th Fibonacci number.

Here is an example usage of the function:
```
print(fibonacci(5)) # Output: 5
print(fibonacci(8)) # Output: 21
```
Note that this function is not optimized and will not perform well for large values of n. A more efficient approach would be to use a memoization technique to store the previously calculated values of the Fibonacci sequence, which would reduce the number of recursive calls and improve the performance of the function.</s>
