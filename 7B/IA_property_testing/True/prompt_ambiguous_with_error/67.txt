```
In this test suite, we use the `hypothesis` library to generate test cases for the `property_test` function. The `strategies` module provides a set of pre-defined strategies for generating random data. In this case, we use `strategies.text()` to generate random strings of apples and oranges, and `strategies.integers()` to generate random integers for the total number of fruit in the basket.

The `property_1` function checks that the function returns the correct number of mango fruit when there are apples and oranges in the basket. It does this by first splitting the input string into a list of apples and oranges, and then subtracting the length of this list from the total number of fruit in the basket. It then checks that the function returns this difference as the number of mango fruit.

The `property_2` function checks that the function returns 0 when there are no mangos in the basket. It does this by first splitting the input string into a list of apples and oranges, and then checking that the length of this list is 0. It then checks that the function returns 0 as the number of mango fruit.

Note that these tests are only a subset of the possible test cases for this function, and there may be additional cases that could be added to ensure that the function is thoroughly tested.</s>  ```
def count_mangoes(apples_and_oranges_str, total_fruit):
    apples, oranges = apples_and_oranges_str.split(" ")
    apples = int(apples)
    oranges = int(oranges)
    mangoes = total_fruit - (apples + oranges)
    return mangoes
```
This code assumes that the input string is in the format "apples oranges", where "apples" and "oranges" are integers representing the number of apples and oranges in the basket, respectively. It then splits the string into two integers, "apples" and "oranges", and calculates the total number of fruit in the basket by adding them together. Finally, it subtracts the number of apples and oranges from the total fruit to get the number of mangoes in the basket.</s>  ```
def count_mangoes(fruit_string, total_fruit):
    apples, oranges = map(int, fruit_string.split())
    return total_fruit - apples - oranges
```</s>  ```
def count_mangoes(fruit_string, total_fruit):
    apples, oranges = fruit_string.split(' ')
    apples = int(apples)
    oranges = int(oranges)
    mangoes = total_fruit - apples - oranges
    return mangoes
```</s>  ```
def count_mangoes(fruit_list, total_fruit):
    num_apples = fruit_list.count('apples')
    num_oranges = fruit_list.count('oranges')
    num_mangoes = total_fruit - num_apples - num_oranges
    return num_mangoes
```
This code uses the `count()` method of the `list` class to count the number of occurrences of each fruit in the list. It then subtracts the number of apples and oranges from the total number of fruit in the basket to get the number of mangoes.</s>  Here's a Python solution to the problem:
```
def count_mango_fruit(basket_string, total_fruit_count):
    apple_count, orange_count = basket_string.split(',')
    mango_count = total_fruit_count - int(apple_count) - int(orange_count)
    return mango_count
```
This function takes two arguments: `basket_string`, which is a string that represents the number of apples and oranges in the basket, and `total_fruit_count`, which is the total number of fruit in the basket. The function first splits the `basket_string` into two parts using the `split()` method, and then uses the `int()` method to convert the two parts into integers. The function then calculates the number of mango fruit in the basket by subtracting the number of apples and oranges from the total number of fruit in the basket. Finally, the function returns the number of mango fruit in the basket.

For example, if the `basket_string` is `"3,4"`, which represents 3 apples and 4 oranges, and the `total_fruit_count` is 10, the function would return 7 (the number of mango fruit in the basket).</s>  ```
def get_mango_count(fruit_str, total_fruit_count):
    apple_count, orange_count = map(int, fruit_str.split())
    return total_fruit_count - apple_count - orange_count
```
Explanation:

The function first splits the input string into two parts using the `split()` method, which returns a list of substrings. The first sublist contains the number of apples and the second sublist contains the number of oranges.

Next, we convert the sublists into integers using the `map()` method and the `int()` function.

Finally, we subtract the number of apples and oranges from the total number of fruit in the basket to get the number of mango fruit in the basket.

Note that this solution assumes that the input string is in the format "number of apples number of oranges", where both numbers are separated by a space.</s>  ```
def count_mangoes(string, total):
    apples, oranges = string.split(" ")
    apples = int(apples)
    oranges = int(oranges)
    mangoes = total - (apples + oranges)
    return mangoes
```
This code first splits the input string into two parts using the space character as the delimiter. The first part represents the number of apples, and the second part represents the number of oranges. The code then converts these strings to integers using the int() function. Finally, the code subtracts the number of apples and oranges from the total number of fruit in the basket (which is passed as an argument) to get the number of mangoes in the basket.</s>  ```
def count_mangoes(apples_and_oranges, total_fruit):
    return total_fruit - (apples_and_oranges.count("A") + apples_and_oranges.count("O"))
```
This code uses the `count()` method of the `str` type to count the number of occurrences of "A" (apples) and "O" (oranges) in the `apples_and_oranges` string. The total number of fruit in the basket is then subtracted from the sum of these two counts to obtain the number of mangoes in the basket.</s>  Here is a Python code sample that solves the problem:
```
def count_mango(fruit_string, total_fruit):
    apples, oranges = fruit_string.split()
    apples = int(apples)
    oranges = int(oranges)
    mangoes = total_fruit - apples - oranges
    return mangoes
```
Explanation:

* The `fruit_string` parameter is a string that contains the number of apples and oranges in the basket, separated by a space. For example, if the basket contains 3 apples and 5 oranges, the `fruit_string` would be "3 5".
* The `total_fruit` parameter is the total number of fruit in the basket, including both apples, oranges, and mangos.
* The function first splits the `fruit_string` into two parts using the `split()` method, which gives us the number of apples and oranges in the basket.
* Next, we convert the number of apples and oranges to integers using the `int()` function.
* Finally, we calculate the number of mangoes in the basket by subtracting the number of apples and oranges from the total number of fruit.

Note that this function assumes that the `fruit_string` parameter is a valid string that contains only numbers and spaces. If the string contains other characters, the function will raise a `ValueError`.</s>  ```
def count_mangoes(fruit_string, total_fruit):
    apples, oranges = fruit_string.split(" ")
    apples = int(apples)
    oranges = int(oranges)

The property_test function takes a candidate function as an argument and returns a list containing two property tests: property_1 and property_2.

The first property test, property_1, takes two arguments: fruit_string and total_fruit. It splits the fruit_string into apples and oranges using the split() method, converts the strings to integers using int(), and calculates the number of mango fruit in the basket using the candidate function. It then asserts that the number of mango fruit returned by the candidate function is equal to the calculated number of mango fruit.

The second property test, property_2, also takes two arguments: fruit_string and total_fruit. It splits the fruit_string into apples and oranges using the split() method, converts the strings to integers using int(), and calculates the number of mango fruit in the basket using the candidate function. It then asserts that the number of mango fruit returned by the candidate function is equal to 0 if the sum of the number of apples and oranges is greater than the total number of fruit in the basket.

The property_test function is designed to test the correctness of a future solution to the problem of counting the number of mango fruit in a basket of fruit. The two property tests in the function are designed to cover all possible scenarios and edge cases for the problem.</s>  Here is a sample code to solve the problem:
```
def count_mangoes(apples, oranges, total_fruit):
    return total_fruit - (apples + oranges)
```
Explanation:

The function takes three arguments:

* `apples`: the number of apples in the basket
* `oranges`: the number of oranges in the basket
* `total_fruit`: the total number of fruit in the basket

The function returns the number of mango fruit in the basket, which is the total number of fruit minus the number of apples and oranges.

For example, if the input is `apples=2`, `oranges=3`, and `total_fruit=5`, the function will return `5 - (2 + 3) = 5 - 5 = 0`, since there are no mangoes in the basket.

If the input is `apples=5`, `oranges=2`, and `total_fruit=8`, the function will return `8 - (5 + 2) = 8 - 7 = 1`, since there is one mango in the basket.

Note that the function assumes that the input values are non-negative integers. If the input values can be negative or floating-point numbers, the function may not work correctly.</s>  Here is a solution in Python that uses the `re` module to extract the number of mango fruit from the string:
```
import re

def get_mango_count(basket_str, total_fruit):
    # Find the number of mango fruit in the basket
    mango_count = re.search(r'\bmango\b', basket_str).end() - re.search(r'\bmango\b', basket_str).start()
    
    # Check if the number of mango fruit is less than the total number of fruit in the basket
    if mango_count < total_fruit:
        return mango_count
    else:
        return -1
```
This solution uses the `re.search()` function to find the first occurrence of the word "mango" in the `basket_str` string. It then calculates the number of mango fruit in the basket by subtracting the starting position of the match from the ending position of the match.

If the number of mango fruit is less than the total number of fruit in the basket, the function returns the number of mango fruit. Otherwise, it returns -1 to indicate that there are more mango fruit in the basket than there are apples and oranges.

For example, if `basket_str` is "2 apples, 3 oranges, 1 mango" and `total_fruit` is 6, the function will return 1 (the number of mango fruit in the basket). If `basket_str` is "2 apples, 3 oranges, 1 mango" and `total_fruit` is 3, the function will return -1 (indicating that there are more mango fruit in the basket than there are apples and oranges).</s>  ```
def count_mangoes(fruit_string, total_fruit):
    apples, oranges = map(int, fruit_string.split())
    mangoes = total_fruit - apples - oranges
    return mangoes
```
Explanation:

The function takes two parameters: `fruit_string` and `total_fruit`. `fruit_string` is a string that represents the number of apples and oranges in the basket, separated by a space. `total_fruit` is an integer that represents the total number of fruit in the basket.

The function first converts the `fruit_string` to a list of integers using the `map()` function and the `int()` function. The `map()` function applies the `int()` function to each element in the list, converting each element from a string to an integer.

The function then splits the list of integers into two parts: apples and oranges. The `split()` function is used to split the list into two lists, with the first list containing the number of apples and the second list containing the number of oranges.

The function then calculates the number of mangoes in the basket by subtracting the number of apples and oranges from the total number of fruit in the basket. The `total_fruit` variable is subtracted from the `apples` and `oranges` variables to get the number of mangoes.

The function returns the number of mangoes in the basket.

Example usage:
```
fruit_string = "3 2"
total_fruit = 5

print(count_mangoes(fruit_string, total_fruit))  # Output: 2
```</s>  ```
def count_mangoes(fruit_string, total_fruit):
    apples, oranges = map(int, fruit_string.split())
    mangoes = total_fruit - apples - oranges
    return mangoes
```</s>  ```
def count_mangoes(apples, oranges, total_fruit):
    return total_fruit - apples - oranges
```</s>  ```
def get_mango_count(fruit_string, total_fruit_count):
    apple_count = fruit_string.count("apples")
    orange_count = fruit_string.count("oranges")
    mango_count = total_fruit_count - apple_count - orange_count
    return mango_count
```
This code works by first counting the number of apples and oranges in the fruit string using the `count` method. It then subtracts the number of apples and oranges from the total number of fruit in the basket to get the number of mango fruit. Finally, it returns the number of mango fruit.

Note that this code assumes that the input string is a valid representation of the fruit in the basket, and that the total number of fruit in the basket is a positive integer. If the input string or total number of fruit is not a valid input, the code may produce incorrect results or throw an error.</s>  ```
def count_mangoes(basket):
    apples, oranges, mangoes = basket.split()
    return int(mangoes)
```
This code assumes that the input string is in the format of "apples oranges mangoes", where apples and oranges are separated by a space, and mangoes is at the end of the string. The `split()` method is used to split the string into a list of strings, where each string represents a fruit. The `int()` function is used to convert the string representing the number of mangoes into an integer.</s>  ```
def count_mango(basket_string, total_fruit):
    apples, oranges = basket_string.split()
    apples = int(apples)
    oranges = int(oranges)
    mango = total_fruit - apples - oranges
    return mango
```
This code splits the input string into two parts: the number of apples and the number of oranges. It then converts these strings to integers and calculates the total number of fruit in the basket by subtracting the number of apples and oranges from the total number of fruit. Finally, it returns the number of mango fruit in the basket.</s>  def get_mango_count(basket_str, total_fruit_count):
    apple_count, orange_count = map(int, basket_str.split())
    return total_fruit_count - apple_count - orange_count
```</s>  ```
def count_mangoes(fruit_string, total_fruit_count):
    apple_count = fruit_string.count("apples")
    orange_count = fruit_string.count("oranges")
    mango_count = total_fruit_count - apple_count - orange_count
    return mango_count
```
This code uses the `count()` method of strings to count the number of apples and oranges in the fruit string. It then subtracts the total number of apples and oranges from the total number of fruit in the basket to get the number of mangoes in the basket.

Note that this code assumes that the input string contains the words "apples" and "oranges" in lowercase, and that the total number of fruit in the basket is a positive integer. If the input string or total fruit count is not in the expected format, this code will not work as expected.</s>

* The number of mango fruit in the basket is 0 if there are no mangos in the basket.

To run the test suite, simply call the `property_test` function with the candidate function as an argument, like this:

```</s>  Here is a Python function that solves the problem:
```
def count_mangoes(apples, oranges, total_fruit):
    return total_fruit - apples - oranges
```
Explanation:

The function takes three arguments: `apples`, `oranges`, and `total_fruit`. It returns the number of mango fruit in the basket, which is calculated by subtracting the number of apples and oranges from the total number of fruit.

For example, if the input is `apples = 5`, `oranges = 3`, and `total_fruit = 10`, the output should be `2`, since there are 2 mangoes in the basket.

Note that this function assumes that the fruit in the basket are distributed evenly, and that the basket contains only apples, oranges, and mangos. If this is not the case, the function may not produce the correct output.</s>  ```
def count_mangos(basket_string, total_fruit):
    apples, oranges = basket_string.split('a')
    mangos = total_fruit - int(apples) - int(oranges)
    return mangos
```
This code splits the string representing the number of apples and oranges in the basket into two parts using the letter 'a' as the delimiter. The number of apples is stored in the first part of the split string, while the number of oranges is stored in the second part. The total number of fruit in the basket is then calculated by subtracting the number of apples and oranges from the total number of fruit. Finally, the number of mango fruit in the basket is returned.</s>  ```

def count_mangoes(apples_and_oranges, total_fruit):
    # Split the string into a list of individual fruits
    fruits = apples_and_oranges.split()

    for fruit in fruits:
        if fruit == "mango":
            mangoes += 1
    # Return the number of mangoes
    return mangoes
```
This code assumes that the input string will always be in the format "apples oranges mangoes", where the number of apples and oranges is not specified. It also assumes that the total number of fruit in the basket is not specified, and that the code will be given the entire string.

This code uses the `split()` method to split the input string into a list of individual fruits, and then uses a for loop to iterate over the list and count the number of mangoes.

Note that this code does not handle the case where there are no mangoes in the basket, or where there are more than one type of fruit in the basket. If you need to handle these cases, you will need to modify the code accordingly.</s>  ```

    return mango_count
```
This code uses the `int()` function to convert the strings representing the number of apples and oranges into integers, and then subtracts the total number of fruit in the basket from the number of apples and oranges to get the number of mango fruit in the basket.

Note: This code assumes that the input strings will only contain digits, and that the total number of fruit in the basket will be a positive integer. If the input strings can contain other characters or if the total number of fruit in the basket can be zero, you may need to modify the code accordingly.</s>  def count_mangoes(basket):

This test suite has two property tests:

* `property_1` tests the function with a valid input (a string that represents a number of apples and oranges, and the total number of fruit in the basket).
* `property_2` tests the function with invalid inputs (a total number of fruit that is not the sum of the number of apples and oranges, or a number of mangoes that is not equal to the difference between the total number of fruit and the number of apples and oranges).

Both property tests use the `hypothesis` library to generate random test cases. The `given` decorator is used to specify the input parameters for each property test. The `strategies` module is used to generate random values for the input parameters. The `property_test` function returns a list containing the property tests.</s>  ```

```</s>  ```
def count_mangoes(string):
    apples, oranges, mangos = map(int, string.split())
    return mangos
```
This code works by first converting the string to a list of integers using the `map` function with `int` as the function. The list contains the number of apples, oranges, and mangos in the basket. The `count_mangoes` function then returns the number of mangos in the basket by accessing the third element of the list.</s>  ```
def count_mangoes(fruit_string, total_fruit):
    apples, oranges = map(int, fruit_string.split())
    return total_fruit - apples - oranges
```
This code uses the `map()` function to split the input string into two parts, `apples` and `oranges`, and then converts them to integers. The `total_fruit` parameter represents the total number of fruits in the basket, including apples, oranges, and mangoes. The function returns the number of mangoes in the basket by subtracting the number of apples and oranges from the total number of fruits.</s>  ```
def get_mangoes(apples, oranges, total_fruit):
    return total_fruit - apples - oranges
```
Explanation:

The function `get_mangoes()` takes three arguments: `apples`, `oranges`, and `total_fruit`. It returns the number of mangoes in the basket, which is the total number of fruit minus the number of apples and oranges.

For example, if the input is `apples = 5, oranges = 7, total_fruit = 15`, the function will return `15 - 5 - 7 = 3`, which is the number of mangoes in the basket.</s>  ```
def count_mangoes(fruit_string, total_fruit_count):
    apple_count = fruit_string.count("apple")
    orange_count = fruit_string.count("orange")
    mango_count = total_fruit_count - apple_count - orange_count
    return mango_count
```</s>  ```
def count_mango(fruit_string, total_fruit):

    mango = total_fruit - apples - oranges
    return mango
```</s>  ```
def count_mangoes(fruit_string, total_fruit):
    apples, oranges = fruit_string.split()
    apples = int(apples)
    oranges = int(oranges)
    mangoes = total_fruit - apples - oranges
    return mangoes
```</s>  ```
def count_mangoes(string_of_fruit, total_fruit):
    apples, oranges = map(int, string_of_fruit.split())
    mangoes = total_fruit - apples - oranges
    return mangoes
```
This code first splits the string of fruit into the number of apples and oranges using the `split()` method. It then converts the two resulting strings to integers using the `map()` function and the `int()` constructor. Finally, it calculates the number of mangoes in the basket by subtracting the number of apples and oranges from the total number of fruit.</s>  ```
def count_mangoes(fruit_string, total_fruit):
    apple_count = fruit_string.count('a')
    orange_count = fruit_string.count('o')
    mango_count = total_fruit - apple_count - orange_count
    return mango_count
```</s>  ```
def get_mangoes(fruit_string, total_fruit):
    apples, oranges = map(int, fruit_string.split())
    mangoes = total_fruit - apples - oranges
    return mangoes
```
This code works by first converting the input string to a tuple using the `map` function. The `map` function applies the given function to each element in the iterable and returns a new iterable with the results. In this case, the function is `int` which converts the strings to integers.

The resulting tuple contains the number of apples and oranges in the basket. We then use the formula to calculate the number of mangoes in the basket, which is the total number of fruit minus the number of apples and oranges.

The function returns the number of mangoes as an integer.</s>

This test suite includes two property tests:

* Property 1: Tests that the input string is a valid representation of a number, that the input string represents a valid number of apples and oranges, and that the total number of fruit in the basket is equal to the sum of the number of apples and oranges.
* Property 2: Tests that the total number of fruit in the basket is a non-negative integer, and that the number of mango fruit in the basket is equal to the difference between the total number of fruit and the number of apples and oranges.

These property tests ensure that the candidate solution correctly processes the input string and returns the correct number of mango fruit in the basket.</s>  ```
def count_mangoes(apples_oranges, total_fruit):
    return total_fruit - apples_oranges
```
This code assumes that the string contains only the characters 'a' and 'o' to represent the number of apples and oranges, respectively. The `total_fruit` parameter is the total number of fruits in the basket, including apples, oranges, and mangoes. The function returns the number of mangoes in the basket by subtracting the number of apples and oranges from the total number of fruits.</s>  Here is a possible solution:
```
def count_mangoes(fruit_string, total_fruit):
    apples, oranges = fruit_string.split(' ')
    apples = int(apples)
    oranges = int(oranges)
    mangoes = total_fruit - apples - oranges
    return mangoes
```
This solution first splits the input string into two parts using the space character as a delimiter. It then converts each part to an integer using the `int()` function. Finally, it calculates the number of mangoes in the basket by subtracting the number of apples and oranges from the total number of fruit.

Here is an example usage of this function:
```
print(count_mangoes('2 3', 10))  # Output: 5
```
This would output `5`, since the basket contains 10 fruit in total, and there are 2 apples and 3 oranges. Therefore, there are 5 mangoes in the basket.</s>  Here is a sample solution using Python:
```
def count_mangoes(apples_oranges, total_fruit):
    apples, oranges = apples_oranges.split(' ')
    apples = int(apples)
    oranges = int(oranges)
    mangoes = total_fruit - (apples + oranges)
    return mangoes
```
In this solution, we first split the input string into two parts using the space character as a delimiter. We then convert the two parts to integers using the `int()` function.

We then use the `total_fruit` parameter to calculate the number of mangoes in the basket by subtracting the total number of apples and oranges from the total number of fruit in the basket.

Finally, we return the number of mangoes as an integer.</s>  def count_mangoes(apples, oranges, total_fruit):
    return total_fruit - apples - oranges</s>  Here is a sample Python code that solves the problem:
```
def count_mango(apples, oranges, total_fruit):
    return total_fruit - (apples + oranges)
```
In this code, we first calculate the total number of fruit in the basket (which is the sum of the number of apples, oranges, and mangoes). We then subtract the number of apples and oranges from this total to get the number of mangoes.

Note that this code assumes that the fruit in the basket is represented as a single string, where each character in the string corresponds to a fruit. For example, if the string is "3A5O6M", then there are 3 apples, 5 oranges, and 6 mangoes in the basket.</s>  ```
def count_mangoes(fruit_string, total_fruit):
    apples, oranges = fruit_string.split()
    apples = int(apples)
    oranges = int(oranges)
    mangoes = total_fruit - apples - oranges
    return mangoes
```
This code works by first converting the string representation of the number of apples and oranges to integers using the `int()` function. It then calculates the total number of fruit in the basket by adding the number of apples and oranges together. Finally, it subtracts the total number of fruit from the total number of fruit in the basket to find the number of mangoes in the basket.

Note that this code assumes that the string representation of the number of apples and oranges is a valid integer. If the string is not a valid integer, the code will raise a `ValueError`. You can handle this error by wrapping the conversion to integer in a try-except block and returning a default value if the conversion fails.</s>  ```
def count_mango(fruit_str, total_fruit):
    apples, oranges = fruit_str.split()
    apples = int(apples)
    oranges = int(oranges)
    mango = total_fruit - (apples + oranges)
    return mango
```
This code splits the input string into two parts, one representing the number of apples and the other representing the number of oranges. It then converts these strings to integers using the `int()` function. Finally, it calculates the number of mango fruit in the basket by subtracting the sum of apples and oranges from the total number of fruit in the basket.</s>  ```
def get_mango_count(fruit_string, total_fruit_count):

    return mangoes
```
This code uses the `split()` method to separate the string of apples and oranges into two integers, and then uses the `int()` function to convert the strings to integers. Finally, the `total_fruit` is subtracted from the sum of the apples and oranges to get the number of mangoes in the basket.</s>

This test suite contains two property tests for the function:

1. `property_1`: Tests that the function returns the correct number of mango fruit given a string that represents a number of apples and oranges and the total number of fruit in the basket. This test uses the `strategies.text()` strategy to generate a random string that represents a number of apples and oranges, and the `len()` function to calculate the total number of fruit in the basket. The test then asserts that the function returns the correct number of mango fruit.
2. `property_2`: Tests that the function returns the correct number of mango fruit given a string that represents a number of apples and oranges and the total number of fruit in the basket. This test uses the `strategies.text()` and `strategies.integers()` strategies to generate a random string that represents a number of apples and oranges, and a random integer that represents the total number of fruit in the basket. The test then asserts that the function returns the correct number of mango fruit.</s>  ```

This code splits the input string into three parts using the `split()` method, where each part represents the number of apples, oranges, and mangos in the basket. The `int()` function is then used to convert the string representation of the mangoes to an integer. Finally, the number of mangoes is returned.

Note that the input string is assumed to be a whitespace-separated list of integers, with the first integer representing the number of apples, the second integer representing the number of oranges, and the third integer representing the number of mangos.

Explanation:
The function takes two arguments: `fruit_string`, which is a string representing the number of apples and oranges in the basket, and `total_fruit`, which is the total number of fruit in the basket.

First, we split the `fruit_string` into two parts using the space character as the delimiter. This gives us two strings: `apples` and `oranges`, each containing the number of apples and oranges in the basket, respectively.

Next, we convert these strings to integers using the `int()` function.

Finally, we subtract the number of apples and oranges from the total number of fruit in the basket to get the number of mangoes in the basket. We return this result.

Note that this function assumes that the `fruit_string` and `total_fruit` arguments are valid and non-empty. If they are not, the function will raise a `ValueError` or `TypeError` exception. You may want to add additional error handling to handle these cases.</s>  ```

This test suite contains three property tests for the future solution to the given problem. The first test checks that the function correctly returns the number of mango fruit in the basket. The second test checks that the function returns a non-negative result. The third test checks that the function returns a result that is less than or equal to the total number of fruit in the basket.</s>  ```

This code works by first counting the number of apples and oranges in the string using the `count` method of the string object. It then subtracts the number of apples and oranges from the total number of fruit in the basket to get the number of mangoes. Finally, it returns the number of mangoes.

Note that this code assumes that the input string is a valid representation of the fruit in the basket, and that there are no duplicate fruit types (i.e. no more than one of each type of fruit). If these assumptions are not true, the code may not work correctly.</s>  Here's a solution using Python:
```
def get_mangoes(apples, oranges, total_fruit):
    return total_fruit - apples - oranges
```
In this solution, we first calculate the total number of fruit in the basket by subtracting the number of apples and oranges from the total number of fruit. This gives us the number of mangoes in the basket.

Note that this solution assumes that the number of apples and oranges is not negative, and that the total number of fruit is greater than or equal to the number of apples and oranges. If these assumptions are not met, the solution may not work as expected.</s>  ```
def count_mangoes(apples, oranges, total_fruit):
    return total_fruit - apples - oranges
```
This code assumes that the basket contains only apples, oranges, and mangoes. If the basket can contain other types of fruit, you may need to modify the code accordingly.</s>  ```
def count_mangoes(basket_string, total_fruit):
    apples, oranges = map(int, basket_string.split())
    return total_fruit - apples - oranges
```
Explanation:

The function `count_mangoes` takes two arguments: `basket_string`, which is a string that represents the number of apples and oranges in the basket, and `total_fruit`, which is the total number of fruit in the basket.

First, we use the `map` function to split the `basket_string` into a list of two integers, representing the number of apples and oranges in the basket.

Next, we subtract the number of apples and oranges from the total number of fruit in the basket to get the number of mangoes in the basket.

Finally, we return the number of mangoes in the basket.

Note that this function assumes that the string is in the format "apples oranges", where "apples" and "oranges" are integers representing the number of apples and oranges in the basket, respectively. If the string is in a different format, the function may not work correctly.</s>  ```
def count_mangoes(fruit_string, total_fruit):
    apples, oranges = map(int, fruit_string.split())
    return total_fruit - apples - oranges
```
This code first splits the input string into two numbers, representing the number of apples and oranges in the basket, using the `split()` method. It then maps these numbers to integers using the `map()` function. The resulting list is then passed to the `count_mangoes()` function, which returns the total number of mango fruit in the basket by subtracting the number of apples and oranges from the total number of fruit in the basket.</s>  ```
def count_mangoes(apples, oranges, fruit_basket):
    return len(fruit_basket) - apples - oranges
```</s>  ```
def count_mangoes(basket_string, total_fruit):
    apples, oranges = basket_string.split()
    apples = int(apples)
    oranges = int(oranges)
    mangoes = total_fruit - apples - oranges
    return mangoes
```</s>  ```
def count_mangos(fruit_string, total_fruit):
    apples, oranges = fruit_string.split()
    apples = int(apples)
    oranges = int(oranges)
    mangoes = total_fruit - apples - oranges
    return mangoes
```
This code uses the `split()` method to split the `fruit_string` into two parts, `apples` and `oranges`, and then uses the `int()` function to convert them to integers. The `total_fruit` parameter is used to calculate the total number of fruit in the basket, and the `mangoes` variable is calculated by subtracting the number of apples and oranges from the total. The function returns the number of mango fruit in the basket.</s>  ```
def count_mangoes(apples, oranges, basket_fruit):
    return basket_fruit - apples - oranges
```
This code uses the subtraction operator to calculate the number of mangoes in the basket. It assumes that the input variables are the number of apples, oranges, and the total number of fruit in the basket.</s>

The `property_test` function takes a candidate function as input and returns a list of property tests. The property tests are defined using the `hypothesis` library's `given` decorator. The `given` decorator takes a hypothesis strategy as an argument, which is used to generate values for the input parameters of the candidate function.

In this case, the candidate function is assumed to take two input parameters: `basket` (a string of apples, oranges, and mangos) and `total` (the total number of fruit in the basket). The property tests check that the candidate function returns the correct number of mango fruit in the basket.

The `property_1`, `property_2`, and `property_3` functions are defined as follows:

* `property_1` checks that the candidate function returns the correct number of apples in the basket.
* `property_2` checks that the candidate function returns the correct number of oranges in the basket.
* `property_3` checks that the candidate function returns the correct number of mangos in the basket.

The `return` statement at the end of the `property_test` function returns the list of property tests.</s>  ```
def count_mangoes(fruit_string, total_fruit_count):
    apple_count = fruit_string.count('apple')
    orange_count = fruit_string.count('orange')
    mango_count = total_fruit_count - apple_count - orange_count
    return mango_count
```
This code uses the `count()` method of the `str` class to count the number of occurrences of the substring "apple" and "orange" in the `fruit_string`. It then subtracts the number of apples and oranges from the total number of fruit in the basket to get the number of mangoes in the basket.

Note that this code assumes that the `fruit_string` contains only the characters 'apple', 'orange', and 'mango'. If the string contains other characters, the code will not work correctly.</s>  Here is a Python code sample that solves the problem:
```
def get_mango_count(apples, oranges, total_fruit):
    return total_fruit - apples - oranges
```
This code assumes that the number of apples and oranges is a non-negative integer, and that the total number of fruit in the basket is also a non-negative integer. The function simply subtracts the number of apples and oranges from the total number of fruit to get the number of mango fruit in the basket.</s>  ```
def count_mangoes(basket):
    apples, oranges, mangos = basket.split()
    return int(mangos)
```
This code works by first splitting the input string into three parts using the `split()` method, where each part represents the number of apples, oranges, and mangos in the basket, respectively. The `int()` function is then used to convert the string representation of the number of mangos to an integer. Finally, the function returns the integer value of the number of mangos in the basket.</s>  ```
def get_mango_count(basket_str, total_fruit_count):
    apple_count, orange_count = basket_str.split()
    return total_fruit_count - int(apple_count) - int(orange_count)
```</s>  Here's a Python solution that should work:
```
def get_mango_count(basket_string, total_fruit_count):
    apple_count, orange_count = basket_string.split('+')
    apple_count = int(apple_count)
    orange_count = int(orange_count)
    mango_count = total_fruit_count - (apple_count + orange_count)
    return mango_count
```
This solution uses the `split()` method to split the `basket_string` into two parts based on the `+` symbol. The resulting strings are then converted to integers using the `int()` function. The total number of mango fruit in the basket is then calculated by subtracting the number of apples and oranges from the total number of fruit in the basket.

To test this code, you can use the following test cases:
```
basket_string = "2+3"
total_fruit_count = 5
print(get_mango_count(basket_string, total_fruit_count)) # should print 2

basket_string = "4+5"
total_fruit_count = 9
print(get_mango_count(basket_string, total_fruit_count)) # should print 4

basket_string = "1+2"
total_fruit_count = 3
print(get_mango_count(basket_string, total_fruit_count)) # should print 0
```
Note that the `print()` function is used to display the output of the function.</s>  ```
def count_mangoes(basket):
    apples, oranges, mangos = basket.split()
    return int(mangos)
```</s>  ```
def get_mangoes(fruit_str, total_fruit):
    apples, oranges = map(int, fruit_str.split())
    return total_fruit - apples - oranges
```
Explanation:

The function takes two arguments: `fruit_str`, which is a string representing the number of apples and oranges in the basket, and `total_fruit`, which is the total number of fruit in the basket.

The function first splits the `fruit_str` into two parts using the `split()` method, and then maps the result to integers using the `map()` function.

The resulting list contains the number of apples and oranges in the basket. We then subtract the number of apples and oranges from the total number of fruit in the basket to get the number of mangoes in the basket.

Finally, we return the result using the `return` statement.</s>  ```
def count_mangoes(fruit_string, total_fruit):
    apples, oranges = map(int, fruit_string.split())
    mangoes = total_fruit - apples - oranges
    return mangoes
```
This code uses the `split()` method to split the string representation of the fruit into two lists, one containing the number of apples and the other containing the number of oranges. The `map()` function is then used to convert the string representations of the numbers to integers. Finally, the difference between the total number of fruit in the basket and the number of apples and oranges is used to calculate the number of mangoes in the basket.</s>  ```
def get_mangoes(fruit_str, total_fruit):
    apples, oranges = map(int, fruit_str.split())
    return total_fruit - apples - oranges
```
This code first converts the string representation of the fruit to a tuple of integers using the `map()` function. Then, it returns the total number of fruit in the basket minus the number of apples and oranges, which gives us the number of mangoes in the basket.</s>  ```
def count_mango(fruit_string, total_fruit):
    apple_count = fruit_string.count('apple')
    orange_count = fruit_string.count('orange')
    mango_count = total_fruit - apple_count - orange_count
    return mango_count
```
Explanation:

The function takes two arguments: `fruit_string`, which is a string that represents a number of apples and oranges that are distributed in a basket of fruit (containing apples, oranges, and mangos), and `total_fruit`, which is the total number of fruit in the basket.

The function first counts the number of apples and oranges in the fruit string using the `count()` method.

Next, the function subtracts the number of apples and oranges from the total number of fruit to get the number of mango fruit in the basket.

Finally, the function returns the number of mango fruit in the basket.</s>
