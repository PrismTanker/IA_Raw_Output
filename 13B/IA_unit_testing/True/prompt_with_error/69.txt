Prompt: You are given a non-empty list of positive integers. Return the greatest integer that is greater than 
    zero, and has a frequency greater than the value of the integer itself. 
    The frequency of an integer is the number of times it appears in the list.
    If no such a value exist, return -1.

* A list with two numbers greater than themselves should return the second number.
* A list with all negative numbers should return -1.
* A mixed list with both positive and negative numbers should return the first positive number greater than itself.</s>  ```
def get_greatest_integer(my_list):
    # Initialize a dictionary to store the frequency of each integer
    freq = {}
    # Iterate over the list and increment the frequency of each integer
    for num in my_list:
        if num not in freq:
            freq[num] = 1
        else:
            freq[num] += 1
    # Find the greatest integer that is greater than 0 and has a frequency greater than the value of the integer itself
    for num in sorted(freq, reverse=True):
        if num > 0 and freq[num] > num:
            return num
    # If no such integer exists, return -1
    return -1
```
This code works by first creating a dictionary `freq` to store the frequency of each integer in the list. It then iterates over the list and increments the frequency of each integer.

Next, it iterates over the sorted dictionary `freq` in reverse order, starting from the greatest integer. If an integer is found that is greater than 0 and has a frequency greater than the value of the integer itself, it is returned.

If no such integer exists, the function returns -1.

Here are some test cases:
```
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(get_greatest_integer(my_list))  # Should print 5

my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5]
print(get_greatest_integer(my_list))  # Should print 5

my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
print(get_greatest_integer(my_list))  # Should print 6

my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 6]
print(get_greatest_integer(my_list))  # Should print 6

my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 6, 6]
print(get_greatest_integer(my_list))  # Should print 6

my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
print(get_greatest_integer(my_list))  # Should print 7

my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 7]
print(get_greatest_integer(my_list))  # Should print 7

my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 7, 7]
print(get_greatest_integer(my_list))  # Should print 7

my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
print(get_greatest_integer(my_list))  # Should print 8

my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 8]
print(get_greatest_integer(my_list))  # Should print 8

my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 8, 8]
print(get_greatest_integer(my_list))  # Should print 8
```</s>  ```
def get_greater_value(my_list):
    max_value = -1
    for num in my_list:
        if num > 0 and my_list.count(num) > num:
            if max_value < num:
                max_value = num
    return max_value
```
This function iterates through the list and checks if the current element is greater than 0 and has a frequency greater than itself. If a matching element is found, it updates the `max_value` variable and returns it. If no such element is found, it returns -1.

Here are some test cases to demonstrate the function's behavior:
```
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
print(get_greater_value(my_list))  # Output: 10

my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
print(get_greater_value(my_list))  # Output: -1

my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10]
print(get_greater_value(my_list))  # Output: 10

my_list = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
print(get_greater_value(my_list))  # Output: -1
```</s>  ```
import collections

def greatest_greater_frequency(arr):
    counts = collections.Counter(arr)
    max_count = max(counts.values())
    for key, value in counts.items():
        if value > key:
            return key
    return -1
```
This code first uses the `collections.Counter` function to count the frequency of each integer in the list. It then finds the maximum frequency among all the integers. Finally, it checks if there is any integer with frequency greater than its value and returns the first such integer. If no such integer exists, it returns -1.

Here is an example usage of the function:
```
>>> greatest_greater_frequency([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])
3
```
This code returns 3 because the integer 3 has frequency 2, which is greater than its value.

Here is another example:
```
>>> greatest_greater_frequency([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 6])
6
```
This code returns 6 because the integer 6 has frequency 2, which is greater than its value.

Here is an example where there is no integer with frequency greater than its value:
```
>>> greatest_greater_frequency([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
-1
```
This code returns -1 because there is no integer with frequency greater than its value.</s>  ```

    # Find the frequency of each element in the list
    freq = {}
    for i in lst:
        if i in freq:

        else:
            freq[i] = 1

    # Find the greatest element greater than 0 with a frequency greater than its value
    for i in sorted(freq, reverse=True):
        if i > 0 and freq[i] > i:
            return i

    # If no such element exists, return -1
    return -1
```
Here's an example usage of the function:
```
print(find_greater_frequent([1, 2, 3, 2, 1])) # Should print 2
print(find_greater_frequent([1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 2])) # Should print 2
print(find_greater_frequent([1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 2, 3])) # Should print 3
print(find_greater_frequent([1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4])) # Should print 4
print(find_greater_frequent([1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5])) # Should print 5
```
Note that this function assumes that the input list is non-empty and contains only positive integers. If the list is empty or contains negative integers, the function will return an error.</s>  ```

```
This function takes a non-empty list of positive integers as input and returns the greatest integer that is greater than zero and has a frequency greater than the value of the integer itself. If no such value exists, it returns -1.

For example, if the input list is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], the function would return 9, because 9 has a frequency of 1 and is greater than 0.

If the input list is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 9], the function would return 9, because 9 has a frequency of 2 and is greater than 0.

This function first creates a dictionary `freq` that maps each integer in the list to its frequency. It then iterates through the dictionary and finds the greatest frequency that is greater than the value of the integer itself. If no such frequency exists, it returns -1.

For example, if the input list is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the output will be `5` because the frequency of `5` is `2`, which is greater than `5`. If the input list is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, the output will be `-1` because there is no integer in the list with a frequency greater than the value of the integer itself.</s>  ```

This function first uses the `collections.Counter` class to count the frequency of each integer in the list.

            return key
    return -1
```

This function uses the `collections.Counter` class to count the frequency of each integer in the list. It then iterates over the counter dictionary and checks if the frequency of an integer is greater than the integer itself. If such an integer is found, it is returned. If no such integer is found, the function returns -1.

Here is an example usage of the function:
```
lst = [1, 2, 3, 2, 1]
result = get_greatest_frequent_integer(lst)
print(result)  # Output: 2

In this example, the function returns 2 because it is the only integer in the list that has a frequency greater than the value of the integer itself (itself).</s>  ```

    for num, count in counts.items():
        if count > max_count and num > 0:
            return num
    return -1
```
This function first creates a dictionary `counts` to keep track of the frequency of each integer in the list. It then finds the maximum frequency in the list and iterates through the dictionary to find the first integer that has a frequency greater than the maximum frequency and is greater than 0. If such an integer is not found, it returns -1.

This function runs in O(n) time, where n is the length of the input list, and O(n) space, where n is the number of unique integers in the list.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```
print(get_greatest_greater([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]))
# Output: 11

    for num, count in freq.items():
        if count > num:
            return num
    return -1
```

This function uses a dictionary to keep track of the frequencies of each integer in the list. It then iterates through the dictionary and returns the first key with a value greater than its frequency, or -1 if no such key exists.

Here is an example usage of the function:
```
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
print(get_greatest_integer(my_list))  # Output: 10

my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
print(get_greatest_integer(my_list))  # Output: -1

This function first creates a dictionary to keep track of the frequencies of each integer in the list. Then, it iterates over the sorted keys of the dictionary in descending order, and returns the first key that has a frequency greater than its value. If no such key is found, it returns -1.

For example, if the input list is `[1, 2, 3, 2, 1]`, the function will return `3`, because 3 is the only integer that appears more than once in the list and has a frequency greater than its value.

Note that the function uses the `sorted` function with the `reverse` parameter set to `True` to sort the keys of the dictionary in descending order. This allows us to iterate over the keys in descending order, which is more efficient than sorting the list in descending order and then searching for the greatest integer.</s>  ```

            max_freq = my_list.count(num)
            greatest_integer = num
    return greatest_integer
```
This function takes a list of positive integers as input, and returns the greatest integer that has a frequency greater than the value of the integer itself. If no such integer exists, it returns -1.

Here's an example of how to use this function:
```
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
greatest_integer = get_greatest_integer(my_list)
print(greatest_integer) # Output: 10
```
This code will print 10, because the frequency of 10 is greater than the value of 10.

Note that this function assumes that the input list is non-empty and contains only positive integers. If the input list is empty or contains negative integers, the function will return -1.</s>  ```
def find_greater_frequent_value(lst):

    for key, value in counts.items():
        if value > max_count:
            return key
    return -1
```
This function iterates through the list and uses a dictionary to keep track of the frequency of each integer. It then finds the maximum frequency and checks if there is any integer with a frequency greater than the maximum. If there is, it returns that integer, otherwise it returns -1.

Note that this function assumes that the input list is non-empty and contains only positive integers. If the input list is empty or contains negative integers, the function will return -1.</s>  ```
def find_greatest_greater(arr):
    count = {}
    for i in arr:

        else:
            count[i] = 1
    
    max_val = -1
    for i in count:
        if count[i] > i:
            max_val = i
            break
    
    return max_val
```
This function first creates a dictionary `count` to keep track of the frequency of each integer in the list. It then iterates through the dictionary and finds the first integer `i` such that `count[i] > i`. If such an integer is found, it is returned. Otherwise, `-1` is returned.

Here is an example of how to use the function:
```
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
print(find_greatest_greater(arr))  # Output: 8
```
In this example, the greatest integer that is greater than 0 and has a frequency greater than the value of the integer itself is 8, which appears 2 times in the list.

Note that this function assumes that the list is non-empty and contains only positive integers. If the list is empty or contains negative integers, the function may not work correctly.</s>  ```

    for num, freq in freq.items():
        if freq > num:
            greatest = max(greatest, num)
    return greatest
```
This code first creates a dictionary `freq` to store the frequency of each number in the input list. It then iterates over the dictionary to find the greatest number that has a frequency greater than its value. If no such number exists, it returns -1.

For example, if the input list is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`, the output would be 10, since it has a frequency of 1. If the input list is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`, the output would be -1, since no number in the list has a frequency greater than its value.</s>  ```

            return key

```
This code uses the `collections.Counter` class to count the frequency of each integer in the input list. It then finds the maximum frequency and iterates through the counter to find the first integer that has a frequency greater than the maximum frequency. If no such integer is found, it returns -1.</s>  ```

This function uses a dictionary to keep track of the frequency of each integer in the list. It then finds the maximum frequency and returns the first integer that has that frequency and is greater than 0, or -1 if no such integer exists.

Here are some test cases:
```
print(get_greater_frequent_integer([1, 2, 3, 2, 1])) # Should be 2
print(get_greater_frequent_integer([1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2])) # Should be 2
print(get_greater_frequent_integer([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])) # Should be -1
```</s>  ```
def get_greatest_integer(lst):
    max_freq = -1
    greatest_integer = -1
    for num in lst:
        if num > 0 and lst.count(num) > max_freq:
            max_freq = lst.count(num)
            greatest_integer = num
    return greatest_integer
```
This function takes a list of positive integers as an argument and returns the greatest integer that is greater than zero and has a frequency greater than the value of the integer itself. If no such integer exists, it returns -1.

For example, if the input list is [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3], the function should return 3 because it appears twice in the list and is greater than the frequency of 1.

You can test this function with the following code:
```
assert get_greatest_integer([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3]) == 3
assert get_greatest_integer([1, 1, 2, 2]) == -1
assert get_greatest_integer([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == -1
```</s>  ```
def find_greater_frequent_integer(lst):
    if len(lst) == 0:
        return -1
    counts = {}
    for num in lst:
        if num > 0:
            if num not in counts:
                counts[num] = 1
            else:
                counts[num] += 1
    max_count = max(counts.values())
    for num in counts:
        if counts[num] == max_count:
            return num
    return -1
```

This function first checks if the input list is empty and returns -1 if it is. Then, it creates a dictionary to keep track of the frequencies of each integer in the list. It iterates through the list and checks if each integer is greater than 0, and if it is not in the dictionary, it adds it with a frequency of 1. If it is already in the dictionary, it increments its frequency.

After iterating through the list, the function finds the maximum frequency in the dictionary and then iterates through the dictionary again to find the integer that has the maximum frequency. If such an integer is found, it is returned. If no such integer is found, -1 is returned.</s>

This function first creates a dictionary to store the frequency of each integer in the list. Then, it finds the maximum frequency among all the integers in the list. Finally, it iterates through the dictionary and returns the first integer with a frequency greater than the maximum frequency, or -1 if no such integer exists.

For example, if the input list is [1, 2, 3, 2, 1], the function will return 3, because it has a frequency of 2, which is greater than the frequency of 1, which is 2.

The function uses the `max` function from the `math` module to find the maximum value in the dictionary, and the `items` method to iterate through the dictionary.

Here is an example of how to use the function:
```
print(get_greatest_value([1, 2, 3, 2, 1]))  # prints 3
print(get_greatest_value([1, 2, 2, 2]))  # prints -1

This code uses the `collections.Counter` class to count the frequency of each integer in the list. It then finds the maximum frequency and checks if there is an integer with a frequency greater than the maximum frequency. If such an integer is found, it is returned, otherwise `-1` is returned.

For example, if the input list is `[1, 2, 3, 2, 1]`, the output would be `3` since `3` appears twice in the list, while `1` and `2` appear only once each. If the input list is `[1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 3]`, the output would be `-1` since no integer appears more than twice in the list.</s>  ```

This code uses the `get()` method of dictionaries to retrieve the value corresponding to a key, or a default value if the key is not present in the dictionary. This allows us to count the frequency of each integer in the list without having to iterate over the list multiple times. The `max()` function is used to find the maximum frequency in the dictionary, and then we iterate over the dictionary to find the integer with the maximum frequency that is greater than the value of the integer itself. If no such integer exists, we return -1.

For example, if we pass the list `[1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4]`, the function will return `4`, because the integer `4` appears four times in the list, which is greater than the value of the integer itself. If we pass the list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the function will return `-1`, because no integer appears more than once in the list and has a frequency greater than the value of the integer itself.</s>  ```

This test suite tests various edge cases, including an empty list, a list with only one element, a list with two elements, and a list with more than ten elements. Each test has a corresponding output, which is the expected result for the given input. The output is set to -1 for all tests, as the problem statement states that the greatest integer that is greater than zero and has a frequency greater than the value of the integer itself does not exist.</s>  ```

This code first creates a dictionary to store the frequencies of each integer in the list. It then finds the maximum frequency in the list and checks if there is an integer with a frequency greater than the maximum frequency. If such an integer is found, it returns it. Otherwise, it returns -1.

For example, if the input list is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 2, 3, 4]`, the output would be `5` because the frequency of `5` is greater than the value of `5` itself.

Note that this code assumes that the input list is non-empty and contains only positive integers.</s>  ```
def get_greater_frequency_integer(my_list):
    # Find the maximum frequency of an integer in the list
    max_freq = max(my_list.count(i) for i in my_list)

    # Find the integer with the maximum frequency
    max_freq_integer = my_list[my_list.count(i) == max_freq][0]

    # Check if the maximum frequency integer is greater than 0
    if max_freq_integer > 0:
        return max_freq_integer
    else:
        return -1
```
This function uses the `count()` method of the list to find the frequency of each integer in the list, and then uses the `max()` function to find the maximum frequency. It then finds the integer with the maximum frequency using a list comprehension, and checks if it is greater than 0. If it is, it is returned, otherwise -1 is returned.

Here's an example of how the function can be used:
```
>>> my_list = [1, 2, 3, 2, 1]
>>> get_greater_frequency_integer(my_list)
2
```
In this example, the list `my_list` contains the integers 1, 2, and 3, with frequencies of 2, 2, and 1 respectively. The function returns 2, which is the integer with the maximum frequency that is greater than 0.

It's important to note that this function assumes that the list contains only positive integers. If the list contains negative integers, the function may not work as expected.</s>  ```

    for num in counts:
        if counts[num] > num:

```
This code uses the `collections` module to count the frequency of each integer in the list. It then iterates through the counts and returns the first integer that has a frequency greater than the value of the integer itself. If no such integer exists, it returns -1.

For example, if the input list is `[1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4]`, the output would be 4, since it is the first integer that has a frequency greater than its value (3). If the input list is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, the output would be -1, since no such integer exists.</s>  ```

    return -1
```
This code first initializes a dictionary, `freq`, to store the frequency of each integer in the list. It then loops through the list and increments the frequency of each integer. Next, it finds the maximum frequency using the `max` function and the `values` method of the dictionary. Finally, it loops through the dictionary again and returns the key (integer) with the maximum frequency, or -1 if no such integer exists.</s>  ```

    # Check if there is a greater frequency
    for i in range(1, max_freq_int):
        if arr.count(i) > arr.count(max_freq_int):
            return i

    return -1
```

This function uses the `count()` method of the list to find the frequency of each integer in the list. It then finds the integer with the maximum frequency and checks if there is a greater frequency than the maximum frequency integer. If there is, it returns the integer with the greater frequency, otherwise it returns -1.

For example, if the input list is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`, the output will be `10`. If the input list is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`, the output will be `-1`.</s>  ```

Here, we use a dictionary to keep track of the frequencies of each integer in the list. We iterate through the list and increment the frequency of each integer. Then, we iterate through the dictionary and return the first key whose value is greater than the key itself. If no such key is found, we return -1.</s>  ```

This function takes in a list of positive integers and returns the greatest integer that has a frequency greater than the value of the integer itself. If no such integer exists, it returns -1.

Here's an example of how the function can be used:
```
print(find_greater_frequent_integer([1, 2, 3, 2, 1])) # Should print 2
print(find_greater_frequent_integer([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])) # Should print -1

Note that this function assumes that all the integers in the input list are positive. If you need to handle negative integers as well, you can modify the function accordingly.</s>  ```

This code first creates a dictionary `freq_dict` to store the frequency of each integer in the list. Then, it iterates through the dictionary and finds the greatest integer that has a frequency greater than itself. If no such integer exists, it returns -1.

Note that this code assumes that the input list is non-empty. If the list is empty, it will return -1.

You can test this function with the following code:
```
assert get_greatest_integer([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == 5
assert get_greatest_integer([1, 2, 3, 4]) == -1

This code first creates a dictionary `freq` that maps each integer in the list to its frequency.

This function first initializes `max_freq` and `greater_value` to 0 and -1, respectively. It then iterates through the list of integers and checks if the current integer is greater than 0 and has a frequency greater than the current value of `max_freq`. If so, it updates `max_freq` to the frequency of the current integer and `greater_value` to the current integer. Finally, it returns `greater_value`.</s>

This function takes in a list of positive integers `arr` and returns the greatest integer that has a frequency greater than its value, or -1 if no such integer exists. The function uses the `count` method of lists to count the frequency of each integer in the list. It then iterates through the list of integers and updates the `max_freq` and `greatest_integer` variables accordingly. Finally, it returns the `greatest_integer` value.

For example, if the input list is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`, the output would be 10, since it is the only integer that has a frequency greater than its value. If the input list is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`, the output would be -1, since no integer has a frequency greater than its value.</s>  ```

This function uses the `collections.Counter` class to count the frequency of each integer in the list. It then finds the maximum frequency and iterates over the counter to find the integer with the maximum frequency that is greater than the value of the integer itself. If no such integer exists, it returns -1.

This function works by first creating a dictionary `counts` to keep track of the frequency of each integer in the list. Then, it iterates through the list and increments the frequency of each integer it finds. Finally, it iterates through the dictionary and checks if the frequency of each integer is greater than the integer itself. If it finds such an integer, it returns it, otherwise it returns -1.

Here is an example usage of the function:
```
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

This function uses a dictionary to keep track of the frequency of each integer in the list. It then iterates through the dictionary and returns the first key with a value greater than its corresponding value. If no such key is found, it returns -1.

For example, if the input list is `[1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4]`, the function would return 4 because it is the first integer with a frequency greater than its value. If the input list is `[1, 1, 1, 1]`, the function would return -1 because no such integer exists.</s>  ```

    for num in freq:
        if freq[num] > num:
            return num
    return -1
```
Here's an explanation of the code:

1. The function takes in a list of positive integers as an argument.
2. The first if statement checks if the list is empty. If it is, return -1.
3. The next line initializes an empty dictionary `freq` to keep track of the frequency of each integer in the list.
4. The for loop iterates over the list and for each integer `num`, if it is already in `freq`, increment its frequency by 1, else add it to `freq` with a frequency of 1.
5. The next for loop iterates over the keys of `freq` and checks if the frequency of each key is greater than the key itself. If so, return the key.
6. If no such key is found, return -1.

This function should work for the given test cases.

For example, if the input list is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`, the function should return 10, since 10 is the greatest integer that is greater than 0 and has a frequency greater than 10.

If the input list is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`, the function should return -1, since no such integer exists.</s>  ```
def greatest_integer(my_list):
    max_freq = 0
    result = -1
    for num in my_list:
        freq = my_list.count(num)
        if freq > max_freq and freq > num:
            max_freq = freq
            result = num
    return result
```
This code uses the built-in `count()` method of lists to count the frequency of each integer in the list. It then checks if the frequency is greater than the value of the integer itself and if it is greater than the previous maximum frequency. If it is, it updates the maximum frequency and the result. Finally, it returns the result. If no such integer exists, it returns -1.

You can test the code with the following test cases:
```
print(greatest_integer([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]))  # Should return 10
print(greatest_integer([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]))  # Should return -1
print(greatest_integer([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10]))  # Should return 10

This function uses a dictionary to keep track of the frequencies of each integer in the list. It then finds the maximum frequency and checks if there is an integer with that frequency that is greater than 0. If such an integer is found, it is returned. Otherwise, -1 is returned.

For example, if the input list is [1, 2, 3, 2, 1], the function will return 3 because it is the only integer with a frequency greater than the value of the integer itself (2). If the input list is [1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 4], the function will return 4 because it is the only integer with a frequency greater than the value of the integer itself (3). If the input list is [1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 4, 5], the function will return -1 because there is no integer with a frequency greater than the value of the integer itself.</s>  ```
def get_greatest_value(my_list):
    max_freq = 0
    greatest_value = -1
    for num in my_list:
        if num > 0 and my_list.count(num) > max_freq:
            max_freq = my_list.count(num)
            greatest_value = num
    return greatest_value
```
This function first initializes `max_freq` and `greatest_value` to 0 and -1, respectively. Then, it iterates through the list and checks if the current number is greater than 0 and if its frequency is greater than `max_freq`. If so, it updates `max_freq` and `greatest_value`. Finally, it returns `greatest_value`.

Note that the `count()` method is used to get the frequency of each number in the list.

Here's an example of how the function can be used:
```
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 2, 1]
print(get_greatest_value(my_list))  # Output: 3
```</s>  ```
def greatest_greater(my_list):
    max_freq = 0
    greatest = -1
    for num in my_list:
        if num > 0 and my_list.count(num) > max_freq:
            max_freq = my_list.count(num)
            greatest = num
    return greatest
```
This function takes in a list of integers and returns the greatest integer that is greater than zero and has a frequency greater than the value of the integer itself. If no such integer exists, it returns -1.

For example, if the input list is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`, the output would be `9`, because it appears once in the list and has a frequency of 1, which is greater than the value of the integer itself.

The function first initializes `max_freq` to 0 and `greatest` to -1. It then loops through each integer in the list and checks if the integer is greater than 0 and if its frequency is greater than `max_freq`. If so, it updates `max_freq` and `greatest` accordingly. Finally, it returns `greatest`.

This function is efficient because it only loops through each integer in the list once, and it only updates `max_freq` and `greatest` when necessary. It also uses the built-in `count` method to find the frequency of each integer in the list, which is an O(n) operation. Overall, the time complexity of this function is O(n).</s>
