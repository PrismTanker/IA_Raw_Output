  Here is a JSON test suite for the given problem:
```json
{
    "test_empty_list": {
        "in": {
            "numbers": []

    },
    "test_with_duplicates": {
        "in": {

        },
        "out": [-1, -2, -3, -4, -5]

```
This test suite includes the following test cases:

* `test_empty_list`: Tests an empty list input.
* `test_single_element`: Tests a list with a single element.
* `test_multiple_elements`: Tests a list with multiple elements.
* `test_with_duplicates`: Tests a list with duplicate elements.
* `test_with_negative_numbers`: Tests a list with negative numbers.

Each test case includes an input parameter `numbers` which is a list of integers, and an expected output `out` which is a list of integers representing the rolling maximum elements found until that moment in the sequence.</s>  Here's a possible test suite for the given problem:

This test suite covers various scenarios such as a list with all the same elements, a list with negative numbers, a list with mixed positive and negative numbers, and a list with large numbers.</s>  Here is a test suite in JSON format to test a future solution for the problem of generating a list of rolling maximum elements from a given list of integers:

def rolling_max(my_list):
    return [max(my_list[:i+1]) for i in range(len(my_list))]
```
This function uses list comprehension to generate a new list of the rolling maximum elements. The `max` function is used to find the maximum element in the sublist `my_list[:i+1]` for each index `i` in the range of the length of the input list.

Here's an example usage:
```
>>> my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
>>> rolling_max(my_list)
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
```
This code passes the test cases:
```
>>> rolling_max([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
>>> rolling_max([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
>>> rolling_max([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7])
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
```</s>  ```
def rolling_max(my_list):
    return [max(my_list[:i+1]) for i in range(len(my_list))]
```
Example:
```
>>> rolling_max([3, 2, 5, 1, 4])
[3, 3, 5, 5, 5]
```</s>  ```
def rolling_max(my_list):
    result = []
    current_max = float('-inf')
    for num in my_list:
        if num > current_max:
            current_max = num
        result.append(current_max)
    return result
```</s>  ```
def rolling_max(my_list):
    return [max(my_list[:i+1]) for i in range(len(my_list))]
```
This function uses list comprehension to generate a new list where each element is the maximum value of the input list up to that point. The `max` function is used to find the maximum value of the list up to a given index `i`, and the `range` function is used to generate the indices of the input list.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```
my_list = [3, 2, 5, 1, 4, 7]
result = rolling_max(my_list)
print(result) # [3, 3, 5, 5, 7, 7]
```</s>  ```
def get_rolling_maximum(my_list):
    result = []
    current_max = float("-inf")
    for num in my_list:
        if num > current_max:
            current_max = num

def get_rolling_max(my_list):
    return [max(my_list[:i+1]) for i in range(len(my_list))]
```
Here's an example usage of the function:
```
my_list = [3, 2, 5, 1, 4, 6]
print(get_rolling_max(my_list)) # [3, 3, 5, 5, 6, 6]
```
This function uses list comprehension to generate a new list where each element is the maximum value found in the original list up to that point. The `max` function is used to find the maximum value in the list, and the `range` function is used to iterate over the indices of the original list. The resulting list is returned by the function.</s>  ```
def get_rolling_max(my_list):
    return [max(my_list[:i+1]) for i in range(len(my_list))]
```
Example:
```
my_list = [3, 2, 5, 1, 4, 6]
print(get_rolling_max(my_list)) # [3, 3, 5, 5, 6, 6]
```
This function uses list slicing to generate a list of rolling maximum elements. It starts by taking the maximum of the first element of the list, then the maximum of the first two elements, and so on. The resulting list is returned.</s>  ```
def rolling_maximum(my_list):
    result = []
    current_max = None
    for i in range(len(my_list)):
        if current_max is None or my_list[i] > current_max:
            current_max = my_list[i]
        result.append(current_max)
    return result
```</s>  Here is a possible solution using the `itertools` module:
```
from itertools import accumulate

def rolling_max(nums):
    return list(accumulate(nums, max))
```
This solution uses the `accumulate` function from the `itertools` module to compute the rolling maximum of the input list. The `accumulate` function takes two arguments: the first is the iterable to be accumulated, and the second is the function to be applied to each element. In this case, we want to compute the rolling maximum, so we pass the `max` function as the second argument.

Here's an example usage of the `rolling_max` function:
```
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
result = rolling_max(nums)
print(result)  # [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
```
This code will output the list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`, which is the list of rolling maximum elements found until each moment in the input list.</s>  ```
def rolling_max(my_list):
    result = []
    current_max = None
    for element in my_list:
        if current_max is None or element > current_max:
            current_max = element
        result.append(current_max)
    return result
```
Example:
```
>>> rolling_max([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
```</s>
