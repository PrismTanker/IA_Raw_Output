    in the sequence.
-------------------
  Sure, here's a test suite to test a solution for the problem you described:
```
{
    "test1": {
        "in": {
            "lst": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
        },
        "out": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
    },
    "test2": {
        "in": {
            "lst": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
        },
        "out": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
    },
    "test3": {
        "in": {
            "lst": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]
        },
        "out": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]
    },
    "test4": {
        "in": {
            "lst": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]
        },
        "out": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]
    },
    "test5": {
        "in": {
            "lst": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]
        },
        "out": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]
    },
    "test6": {
        "in": {
            "lst": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]
        },
        "out": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]
    },
    "test7": {
        "in": {
            "lst": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]
        },
        "out": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]
    }
}
```
In this test suite, we have 7 test cases, each with a different input list and expected output list. The input lists are:

* `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`
* `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`
* `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]`
* `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]`
* `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]`
* `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]`
* `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]`

The expected output lists are:

* `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`
* `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`
* `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]`
* `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]`
* `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]`
* `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]`
* `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]`

The `in` parameter is a list of integers, and the `out` parameter is a list of integers, representing the input and expected output lists for the test cases.</s>  ```
def rolling_maximum(my_list):
    result = []
    current_max = 0
    for i in range(len(my_list)):
        current_max = max(current_max, my_list[i])
        result.append(current_max)
    return result
```
This code works by maintaining a current maximum value and comparing it to each element in the input list. If the element is greater than the current maximum, it becomes the new current maximum. The resulting list of maximum values is then returned.</s>  To generate a list of rolling maximum elements before a given moment in the sequence, you can use the `itertools` module in Python. Specifically, you can use the `itertuples()` method to create an iterator over the sequence, and the `max()` function to find the maximum value in each iteration.

Here is an example code snippet that demonstrates this approach:
```
import itertools

def rolling_max(lst, moment):
    """
    Generate a list of rolling maximum elements before a given moment in the sequence.

    Parameters:
        lst (list): A list of integers.
        moment (int): The moment before which to generate the rolling maximum elements.

    Returns:
        A list of rolling maximum elements before the given moment.
    """
    rolling_max_lst = []
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        if i < moment:
            rolling_max_lst.append(max(lst[:i+1]))
    return rolling_max_lst

# Test the function with a list of integers and a given moment.
lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
moment = 5
print(rolling_max(lst, moment))  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```
In this code, the `rolling_max()` function takes two arguments: `lst` (the list of integers) and `moment` (the moment before which to generate the rolling maximum elements). It creates an iterator over the sequence using the `itertuples()` method, and then iterates over the sequence using a for loop. For each iteration, it finds the maximum value in the sequence using the `max()` function, and appends it to the `rolling_max_lst` list. Finally, it returns the `rolling_max_lst` list.

Note that the `itertuples()` method is used to create an iterator over the sequence, which allows the function to iterate over the sequence without having to store the entire sequence in memory. This can be useful when working with large sequences.</s>  Here is an example of how you can use the `itertools` module to solve this problem:
```
import itertools

def rolling_maximum(lst):
    return list(itertools.accumulate(lst, lambda x, y: max(x, y)))
```
This function takes a list of integers as input and returns a list of the rolling maximum elements found before each moment in the sequence. The `accumulate` function from the `itertools` module is used to compute the rolling maximum. The lambda function is used to compute the maximum of each element in the sequence.

For example, if you have the following list:
```
lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
```
You can use the `rolling_maximum` function to generate the following list of rolling maximum elements:
```
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
```
This list shows the rolling maximum element found before each moment in the sequence. For example, the maximum element before the first moment is 1, the maximum element before the second moment is 2, and so on.</s>  To generate a list of rolling maximum elements found before each moment in the sequence, we can use the `max()` function with a generator expression.
```
def rolling_max(numbers):
    return [max(numbers[:i+1]) for i in range(len(numbers))]
```
This function takes a list of integers `numbers` as input, and returns a list of integers where each integer is the maximum value found in the first `i+1` elements of the input list before the `i+1`th element.

For example, if we call the function with the list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`, it will return the list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`.

If we call the function with the list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]`, it will return the list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]`.

If we call the function with the list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`, it will return the list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`.

The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the length of the input list, because we only need to iterate through the list once and use the `max()` function to find the maximum value in each subsequence of length 1 through n.</s>  ```
def get_rolling_max(my_list):
    result = []
    for i in range(len(my_list)):
        result.append(max(my_list[:i+1]))
    return result
```
This code uses a simple loop to iterate through the list of integers and keeps track of the maximum element found so far by comparing it to the current element. The maximum element is appended to the result list at each iteration. The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input list.</s>  To generate a list of rolling maximum elements found before a given moment in the sequence, you can use a combination of the `max()` function and list slicing.

Here's an example code snippet that demonstrates this:
```
def rolling_max(lst, moment):
    return [max(lst[:i+1]) for i in range(moment)]
```
This code defines a function called `rolling_max()` that takes two arguments: `lst` (the input list of integers) and `moment` (the moment before which to find the rolling maximum).

The function first creates a list comprehension that iterates over the range of integers from 0 to `moment`. For each iteration, the function uses the `max()` function to find the maximum element in the first `i+1` elements of the input list.

Finally, the function returns the list comprehension as the output.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```
lst = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19]
moment = 5

print(rolling_max(lst, moment)) # Output: [5, 7, 9, 11, 13]
```
In this example, the input list is `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19]`, and the moment is `5`. The function returns the list `[5, 7, 9, 11, 13]` as the output, which contains the rolling maximum elements found before the moment `5` in the input list.</s>  ```
def rolling_max(my_list):
    result = []
    max_value = None
    for i in range(len(my_list)):
        if max_value is None or my_list[i] > max_value:
            max_value = my_list[i]
        result.append(max_value)
    return result
```</s>  Here is a Python code that solves the problem:
```
def rolling_max(my_list):
    max_list = []
    for i in range(len(my_list)):
        max_list.append(max(my_list[:i+1]))
    return max_list
```
This code uses a list comprehension to iterate over the given list of integers and appends the maximum element found so far to the resulting list. The `max()` function is used to find the maximum element in the sublist up to the current index.

For example, if the input list is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`, the output list will be `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`.

Note that this code uses the built-in `max()` function, which is part of the Python standard library.</s>  To generate a list of rolling maximum elements found before a given moment in the sequence, you can use the `max` function with a generator expression. The generator expression will iterate through the input list and yield the maximum element found so far.
```
def rolling_max(input_list):
    return [max(input_list[:i+1]) for i in range(len(input_list))]
```
For example, if `input_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]`, the output will be `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]`.

You can also use the `itertools` module to achieve the same result. The `itertools.accumulate` function can be used to calculate the running maximum of a sequence.
```
from itertools import accumulate

def rolling_max(input_list):
    return list(accumulate(input_list, max))
```
Both of these methods are O(n) time complexity and O(1) space complexity, where n is the length of the input list.</s>  ```
def rolling_max(my_list):
    result = []
    for i in range(len(my_list)):
        result.append(max(my_list[:i+1]))
    return result
```
This code uses the `max` function to find the maximum element in the sublist of `my_list` up to and including the current index `i`. The resulting list `result` contains the rolling maximum elements found before each moment in the sequence.</s>
