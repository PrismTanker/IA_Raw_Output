def swap_capital_chars(string):
    return string.swapcase()
```
This code uses the built-in `swapcase()` method of the string object to swap the capital and lowercase letters in the given string. The `swapcase()` method is a shortcut for swapping the case of all characters in a string, so it is a more efficient and concise way to solve this problem.

Here is an example of how to use this function:
```
print(swap_capital_chars("Hello World")) # Output: "hELLO wORLD"
```
This function will work for any string that contains capital and lowercase letters, and it will return a new string with the capital and lowercase letters swapped.</s>  ```
def swap_capitals(s):
    return ''.join(c.lower() if c.islower() else c.upper() for c in s)
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each character in the input string, and checks if the character is lowercase or uppercase using the `islower()` and `isupper()` methods. If the character is lowercase, it is converted to uppercase using the `upper()` method, and if it is uppercase, it is converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method. The resulting list of characters is then joined into a string using the `join()` method.

Here is an example usage of the function:
```
print(swap_capitals('hello world'))  # Output: 'HELLO WORLD'
print(swap_capitals('Hello World'))  # Output: 'hello world'
```
Note that this function assumes that the input string contains only letters, and will not work correctly if the input string contains any other characters.</s>  ```
def swap_capital_characters(string):
    new_string = ""
    for i in range(len(string)):
        if string[i].isupper():
            new_string += string[i].lower()
        else:
            new_string += string[i].upper()
    return new_string
```
This code will swap the capital and lowercase characters in a given string. For example, if you pass the string "Hello World!" to the function, it will return "hELLO wORLD!".

Note that this code assumes that the string only contains characters that are either uppercase or lowercase. If the string contains any other characters, such as punctuation or special characters, the code may not work as intended.</s>  ```
def swap_capital_characters(string):
    return ''.join(chr(ord(c) ^ 32) if c.isupper() else c for c in string)
```
This code uses the `ord()` and `chr()` functions to swap the case of each character in the input string. The `^ 32` operation is used to toggle the case of each character, effectively swapping the capitalization. The `isupper()` method is used to check if a character is uppercase, and the `join()` method is used to join the characters back together into a string.

For example:
```
print(swap_capital_characters('Hello World')) # prints 'hELLO wORLD'
```
Note that this code assumes that the input string only contains ASCII characters, and it will not work correctly for strings containing Unicode characters.</s>  ```
def swap_capitals(s):
    return ''.join([c.lower() if c.islower() else c.upper() for c in s])
```
This code uses a list comprehension to iterate over each character in the input string `s`. For each character, it checks if the character is lowercase (`c.islower()`) and if it is, it converts it to uppercase (`c.upper()`) and if it is uppercase, it converts it to lowercase (`c.lower()`). The resulting list of characters is then joined back into a string using the `join()` method.

Here is an example of how this function can be used:
```
>>> swap_capitals('Hello World')
'hELLO wORLD'
```
This function will work for any string input, and it will swap the capital and lowercase characters in the string.</s>  ```
def swap_capital_characters(string):
    # Split the string into a list of characters
    char_list = list(string)

    # Loop through the list of characters
    for i in range(len(char_list)):
        # Check if the character is a capital letter
        if char_list[i].isupper():
            # Find the index of the lowercase version of the character
            lowercase_index = ord(char_list[i]) - ord('A') + ord('a')
            # Swap the character with its lowercase version
            char_list[i] = chr(lowercase_index)

    # Join the list of characters back into a string
    return ''.join(char_list)
```
This code takes a string as input and returns a new string where all capital letters have been swapped with their lowercase counterparts. It does this by using the `isupper()` method to check if a character is a capital letter, and the `ord()` and `chr()` functions to convert between ASCII codes and characters. The `list()` function is used to split the input string into a list of characters, and the `join()` function is used to join the list of characters back into a string.

Here is an example of how the function can be used:
```
>>> swap_capital_characters("Hello World")
'hello world'
```
Note that this function will only work for ASCII characters, and may not work for other character encodings.</s>  ```
def swap_capital_characters(s):
    return ''.join(c.lower() if c.isupper() else c.upper() for c in s)
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each character in the input string `s`, and applies the `lower()` method to any character that is uppercase, and the `upper()` method to any character that is lowercase. The resulting list of characters is then joined into a string using the `join()` method.

Here is an example usage of the function:
```
>>> swap_capital_characters('Hello World')
'hELLO wORLD'
```
This function will work for any string that contains both uppercase and lowercase characters. It will not work for strings that only contain uppercase or only contain lowercase characters, as there is nothing to swap in that case.

Note that this function will modify the case of any characters in the input string, but it will not modify the string in any other way. If you want to modify the string in other ways, you can use a different approach, such as using the `replace()` method to replace specific substrings.</s>  ```
def swap_capitals(s):
    return ''.join(chr(ord(c) ^ 32) if c.isupper() else c for c in s)
```
This function uses the `ord` function to get the ASCII code of each character in the input string, and then uses the `chr` function to convert it back to a character. The `^` operator is used to toggle the case of the character. The `isupper` method is used to check if the character is uppercase.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```
>>> swap_capitals('Hello World')
'hELLO wORLD'
```
This function is case-sensitive, so it will not swap the case of characters that are already in the desired case. For example:
```
>>> swap_capitals('hELLO wORLD')
'hELLO wORLD'
```
Note that this function assumes that the input string contains only ASCII characters. If the input string contains non-ASCII characters, this function may not work as expected.</s>  ```
def swap_capital_characters(string):
    return ''.join([char.swapcase() if char.isupper() else char for char in string])
```
This function uses the `swapcase()` method to swap the case of each character in the string, and the `isupper()` method to check if each character is uppercase. The resulting string is then joined using the `join()` method.

Here is an example of how this function can be used:
```
print(swap_capital_characters('Hello World')) # Output: hELLO wORLD
```
This function should work for any string, regardless of the number of capital characters it contains.</s>  ```
def swap_capitals(s):
    return ''.join([c.lower() if c.islower() else c.upper() for c in s])
```
This function takes a string as input and returns the string with capital and lowercase letters swapped.

Here is an example of how to use this function:
```
print(swap_capitals("Hello World"))  # Output: hELLO wORLD
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each character in the input string, and applies the `lower()` or `upper()` method to each character depending on whether it is lowercase or uppercase. The resulting list of characters is then joined back into a string using the `join()` method.

This function can be used to swap the capitalization of any string, regardless of its length or content.</s>
