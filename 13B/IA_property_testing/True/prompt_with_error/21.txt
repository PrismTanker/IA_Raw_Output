from hypothesis import given, strategies

def property_test(candidate_function):
    @given(strategies.lists(elements=strategies.floats, min_size=2))
    def property_1(numbers):
        normalized = candidate_function(numbers)
        assert len(normalized) == len(numbers)

    return [property_1, property_2]
```
This test suite uses the `hypothesis` library to generate lists of floats with at least two elements and applies the candidate function to each list. The first property test `property_1` checks that the length of the normalized list is equal to the length of the original list, and that the smallest element in the normalized list is 0 and the largest element is 1. The second property test `property_2` checks that each element in the normalized list is greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to 1.</s>  ```
import numpy as np

def normalize(numbers):
    return (np.array(numbers) - min(numbers)) / (max(numbers) - min(numbers))
```
This function takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list with the same length, where each element is the normalized value of the corresponding element in the input list. The normalization is done by subtracting the minimum value from each element, and then dividing the result by the range of the values (i.e., the difference between the maximum and minimum values). This gives a value between 0 and 1, where 0 represents the smallest value and 1 represents the largest value.

For example, if the input list is `[3, 5, 2, 7]`, the output list will be `[0.25, 0.625, 0.25, 1]`.

Note that this function assumes that the input list is non-empty and contains at least two elements. If the input list is empty or contains only one element, the function will raise a `ValueError`.

Also, this function uses the `numpy` module, which is a popular scientific computing package for Python, to perform the calculations. The `numpy` module provides a more efficient and concise way of working with arrays of data, which is useful when dealing with large datasets.</s>  ```
import numpy as np

def normalize_list(my_list):
    return (np.array(my_list) - np.min(my_list)) / (np.max(my_list) - np.min(my_list))
```
This code uses the `numpy` library to perform the necessary calculations. The `numpy.min()` function is used to find the minimum value in the list, and the `numpy.max()` function is used to find the maximum value in the list. The difference between the maximum and minimum values is then used as the denominator in the division operation to normalize the list. Finally, the resulting array is converted back to a list using the `numpy.array()` function.

Here is an example usage of the function:
```
>>> normalize_list([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
array([0. , 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8])
```</s>  ```
import numpy as np

def normalize(numbers):
    return (numbers - np.min(numbers)) / (np.max(numbers) - np.min(numbers))
```
Here's an example usage:
```
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(normalize(numbers))  # Output: [0.0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8]
```</s>  ```
import numpy as np

def normalize(numbers):
    # Check if the list has at least two elements
    if len(numbers) < 2:
        raise ValueError("List must have at least two elements")

    # Get the smallest and largest numbers in the list
    smallest = np.min(numbers)
    largest = np.max(numbers)

    # Calculate the normalization factor
    factor = largest - smallest

    # Normalize the list
    normalized = [(number - smallest) / factor for number in numbers]

    return normalized
```
This code uses the `numpy` library to calculate the minimum and maximum values in the list, and then normalizes the list by subtracting the minimum value and dividing by the difference between the minimum and maximum values. It then returns the normalized list.

For example, if the input list is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the output will be `[0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0]`.

Note that this code assumes that the list contains at least two elements. If the list has only one element, it will raise a `ValueError`.</s>  ```
def normalize_list(numbers):
    if len(numbers) < 2:
        raise ValueError("List must have at least two elements")
    min_value = min(numbers)
    max_value = max(numbers)
    return [(number - min_value) / (max_value - min_value) for number in numbers]
```
This function takes in a list of numbers, and returns a new list where each number is normalized to the range [0, 1]. The smallest number in the input list is set to 0, and the largest number is set to 1.

Here's an example of how to use this function:
```
>>> normalize_list([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
[0.0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8]
```</s>  ```
def normalize_list(my_list):
    if len(my_list) < 2:
        return my_list
    min_val = min(my_list)
    max_val = max(my_list)
    return [(x - min_val) / (max_val - min_val) for x in my_list]
```
This code first calculates the minimum and maximum values in the list using the `min()` and `max()` functions. It then uses a list comprehension to iterate over the list and calculate the normalized values, which are the difference between each value and the minimum value, divided by the difference between the maximum and minimum values. Finally, it returns the normalized list.

Note that this code assumes that the list contains at least two elements. If the list contains only one element, it will return the original list without any normalization.

Also, this code assumes that the minimum and maximum values in the list are not equal. If they are equal, the code will raise an error.

To use this function, you can call it with the list of numbers as an argument, like this:
```
normalized_list = normalize_list([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
```
This will return the normalized list `[0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0]`.</s>  ```
def normalize(numbers):
    if len(numbers) < 2:
        raise ValueError("List must have at least two elements")
    min_num = min(numbers)
    max_num = max(numbers)
    return [(num - min_num) / (max_num - min_num) for num in numbers]
```
This code uses the `min` and `max` functions from the `math` module to find the smallest and largest numbers in the list, respectively. It then uses a list comprehension to create a new list where each number is divided by the difference between the maximum and minimum numbers, and then multiplied by the difference between the maximum and minimum numbers. This ensures that the smallest number in the list becomes 0 and the largest number becomes 1.

For example, if the input list is `[2, 4, 6, 8, 10]`, the output list would be `[0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0]`.

Note that this code assumes that the list contains at least two elements. If the list contains only one element, it raises a `ValueError`.</s>  ```
import numpy as np

def normalize(numbers):
    # Check if the list has at least two elements
    if len(numbers) < 2:
        return numbers
    
    # Get the minimum and maximum values in the list
    min_val = min(numbers)
    max_val = max(numbers)
    
    # Normalize the list
    normalized_list = [(number - min_val) / (max_val - min_val) for number in numbers]
    
    return normalized_list
```
This code uses the `numpy` module to calculate the minimum and maximum values in the list. It then uses a list comprehension to normalize the list by subtracting the minimum value and dividing by the range of the values.

For example, if the input list is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the output list will be `[0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8]`.</s>  ```
import numpy as np

def normalize(my_list):
    min_val = np.min(my_list)
    max_val = np.max(my_list)
    return [(i - min_val) / (max_val - min_val) for i in my_list]
```
This function uses the `numpy` module to find the minimum and maximum values in the list, and then uses a list comprehension to calculate the normalized values for each element in the list. The result is a new list with the same number of elements as the input list, but with the normalized values.

To test this function, you can use the following code:
```
import numpy as np

# Test case 1: Normalize a list of integers
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
normalized_list = normalize(my_list)
print(normalized_list)  # Should be [0.0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8]

# Test case 2: Normalize a list of floats
my_list = [1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5, 5.5]
normalized_list = normalize(my_list)
print(normalized_list)  # Should be [0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0]

# Test case 3: Normalize a list of negative numbers
my_list = [-1, -2, -3, -4, -5]
normalized_list = normalize(my_list)
print(normalized_list)  # Should be [-1.0, -0.8, -0.6, -0.4, -0.2]

# Test case 4: Normalize an empty list
my_list = []
normalized_list = normalize(my_list)
print(normalized_list)  # Should be []

# Test case 5: Normalize a list with only one element
my_list = [1]
normalized_list = normalize(my_list)
print(normalized_list)  # Should be [0.0]
```
Note that the `numpy` module is used to find the minimum and maximum values in the list, and the `list comprehension` is used to calculate the normalized values for each element in the list.</s>  ```
import numpy as np

def normalize(numbers):
    min_value = np.min(numbers)
    max_value = np.max(numbers)
    return (numbers - min_value) / (max_value - min_value)
```
This code uses the `numpy` library to calculate the minimum and maximum values of the list, and then subtracts the minimum value from each element to normalize the list. The resulting list is then divided by the difference between the maximum and minimum values to scale the list to the range [0, 1].

Here's an example usage of the function:
```
>>> normalize([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
array([0. , 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8])
```
Note that this function assumes that the input list is not empty, and that the minimum and maximum values are not equal. If either of these conditions is not met, the function will raise a `ValueError`.</s>

This test suite contains four properties:

1. `test_normalized`: Checks that the normalized list has the same length as the original list, and that the smallest element in the original list becomes 0 and the largest element in the original list becomes 1.

3. `test_order_preserved`: Checks that the normalized list preserves the order of the original list.
4. `test_no_zero_or_one`: Checks that the normalized list contains neither 0 nor 1.

These properties cover all the possible cases for a normalization function, and help ensure that the function works correctly for any input list of numbers.</s>  ```

This code uses the `numpy` library to perform the normalization. The `min()` and `max()` functions are used to find the minimum and maximum values in the list, respectively. The subtraction and division operations are then used to normalize the list.

Here is an example usage of the `normalize()` function:

This code uses the `numpy` module to perform the normalization. It first converts the list to a numpy array using the `numpy.array()` function. Then, it finds the minimum and maximum values in the array using the `numpy.min()` and `numpy.max()` functions. Finally, it returns the normalized array by subtracting the minimum value and dividing by the range of values.

To test the function, you can use the following code:

This function takes a list of numbers as input, and returns a new list with the same elements but normalized to the range [0, 1]. It first finds the minimum and maximum values in the input list, and then computes the normalized value for each element by subtracting the minimum and dividing by the range (i.e., maximum - minimum).

```
The `min_value` variable is set to the smallest value in the `numbers` list, and the `max_value` variable is set to the largest value in the `numbers` list. The `return` statement then uses list comprehension to create a new list where each element is the normalized value of the corresponding element in the `numbers` list. The normalized value is calculated by subtracting the `min_value` from the current element, and then dividing the result by the difference between the `max_value` and the `min_value`.</s>  ```

    min_val = min(my_list)
    max_val = max(my_list)
    return [(x - min_val) / (max_val - min_val) for x in my_list]
```
This code first checks if the input list has at least two elements. If it does not, it raises a `ValueError`. If the list has at least two elements, it finds the minimum and maximum values in the list using the `min` and `max` functions, respectively. It then uses a list comprehension to create a new list where each element is the original element minus the minimum value, divided by the difference between the maximum and minimum values. This gives a normalized list where the smallest value is 0 and the largest value is 1.

For example, if the input list is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the output list will be `[0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1]`.

Note that this code assumes that the input list is a list of numbers. If the list contains other types of data, the code may need to be modified accordingly.</s>  ```

    min_value = min(my_list)
    max_value = max(my_list)
    return [(x - min_value) / (max_value - min_value) for x in my_list]
```
This code uses the `statistics` module to calculate the minimum and maximum values in the list. It then uses list comprehension to iterate over the list and calculate the normalized value for each element. The resulting list is returned.

For example, if the input list is `[1, 2, 3]`, the output will be `[0.0, 0.5, 1.0]`. If the input list is `[10, 10, 10]`, the output will be `[0.0, 0.0, 0.0]`. If the input list is `[1, 1, 1]`, the output will be `[0.0, 0.0, 0.0]`.</s>  ```

    return [(x - min_val) / (max_val - min_val) for x in numbers]
```
This code uses the `statistics` module to find the minimum and maximum values in the list. It then uses a list comprehension to subtract the minimum value from each element, divide by the difference between the minimum and maximum values, and return the resulting list.

Here are some test cases:
```
>>> normalize([1, 2, 3])
[0.0, 0.5, 1.0]
>>> normalize([1, 2, 3, 4])
[0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75]
>>> normalize([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
[0.0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8]
```
As you can see, the smallest value in the list becomes 0, and the largest value becomes 1.</s>  ```

    min_val = min(numbers)
    max_val = max(numbers)
    return [(x - min_val) / (max_val - min_val) for x in numbers]
```
This code defines a function `normalize` that takes a list of numbers as input and returns a list of normalized values. The function first checks that the input list has at least two elements, and raises a `ValueError` if it does not.

Next, the function computes the minimum and maximum values in the input list using the `min` and `max` functions.

Finally, the function applies the normalization formula `(x - min_val) / (max_val - min_val)` to each element in the input list, and returns the resulting list of normalized values.

Here is an example usage of the `normalize` function:
```
print(normalize([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))
# Output: [0.0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 1.0]
```
This code calls the `normalize` function with the input list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, and prints the result, which is the list `[0.0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 1.0]`.</s>  ```
def normalize(numbers):
    min_num = min(numbers)
    max_num = max(numbers)
    return [(num - min_num) / (max_num - min_num) for num in numbers]
```
This code uses a list comprehension to iterate over the input list of numbers, subtracting the minimum value from each number and then dividing by the difference between the maximum and minimum values. The resulting list is then returned.

You can test the code with the following example:
```
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
normalized_numbers = normalize(numbers)
print(normalized_numbers)  # [0.0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8]
```</s>  ```

def normalize(my_list):

```
This function takes a list of numbers as input and returns a normalized version of the list, where the smallest number becomes 0 and the largest number becomes 1. It uses the `numpy` library to perform the calculations.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```
>>> my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
>>> normalize(my_list)
array([0. , 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1. ])
```
As you can see, the smallest number in the input list (1) becomes 0 in the output, and the largest number (5) becomes 1. The other numbers are scaled accordingly.</s>  ```

    return [(x - min_val) / (max_val - min_val) for x in numbers]
```
This code uses the `statistics` module to find the minimum and maximum values in the list, and then uses a list comprehension to calculate the normalized values. The resulting list will have values ranging from 0 to 1.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
normalized_numbers = normalize(numbers)

    min_val = np.min(my_list)
    max_val = np.max(my_list)
    return (my_list - min_val) / (max_val - min_val)
```
This function takes a list of numbers as input, converts it to a numpy array, finds the minimum and maximum values in the array, and then subtracts the minimum value and divides the result by the range of values (i.e. the difference between the maximum and minimum values). This will ensure that the smallest value in the list becomes 0 and the largest value becomes 1.

For example, if the input list is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the output will be `[0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1]`.

Note that this function assumes that the input list contains at least two elements. If the list contains only one element, it will raise an error.</s>  ```

This code uses the `statistics` module to find the minimum and maximum values in the list, and then uses a list comprehension to create a new list with the normalized values. The formula used to normalize the values is `(number - min_value) / (max_value - min_value)`, which maps the values in the original list to the range [0, 1].

This code uses the `min` and `max` functions to find the smallest and largest values in the list, respectively. It then subtracts the smallest value from each element in the list and divides it by the difference between the largest and smallest values. This produces a list where the smallest value is 0 and the largest value is 1.

This function takes a list of numbers as input and returns a normalized list where the smallest number becomes 0 and the largest number becomes 1.

To use this function, you can call it with a list of numbers as an argument, like this:
```

This code uses the `numpy` library to perform the normalization operation. It first finds the minimum and maximum values in the input list using the `np.min` and `np.max` functions, respectively. Then, it subtracts the minimum value from each element in the list, and divides the result by the difference between the maximum and minimum values. This produces a normalized list where the smallest value is 0 and the largest value is 1.

This function takes a list of numbers as input, finds the minimum and maximum values in the list, and then normalizes the list by subtracting the minimum value and dividing by the range of the values (i.e., the difference between the maximum and minimum values). The resulting list will have all values between 0 and 1, with the smallest value becoming 0 and the largest value becoming 1.

This code uses the `min` and `max` functions from the Python standard library to find the minimum and maximum values in the input list, respectively. It then uses list comprehension to create a new list where each element is the original value minus the minimum value, divided by the difference between the maximum and minimum values.

This code uses the NumPy library to perform the normalization. First, it converts the list to a NumPy array, which makes it easier to manipulate. Then, it finds the minimum and maximum values in the array using the `np.min()` and `np.max()` functions. Next, it subtracts the minimum value from each element in the array, and divides each element by the range of values (i.e., the difference between the maximum and minimum values). Finally, it returns the normalized array.

Note that this function will only work for lists with at least two elements. If the list has only one element, the function will return the original list without normalizing it.

Also, note that this function will only work for numerical data. If the list contains non-numerical data, the function will raise an error.

The function uses the `numpy` module to perform the normalization. The `sort` function is used to sort the list in ascending order, and the `diff` variable is used to find the difference between the largest and smallest values in the list.

This code will normalize a list of numbers by subtracting the minimum value from each element and then dividing by the range of the list. The range is calculated as the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list. The resulting list will have values between 0 and 1, where 0 corresponds to the minimum value and 1 corresponds to the maximum value.

The `min_val` and `max_val` variables are used to avoid re-calculating the minimum and maximum values for each element in the list.</s>  ```

    min_val = min(my_list)
    max_val = max(my_list)
    return [(x - min_val) / (max_val - min_val) for x in my_list]
```
This code uses the `min()` and `max()` functions to find the minimum and maximum values in the input list, respectively. It then subtracts the minimum value from each element in the list and divides by the difference between the maximum and minimum values. This normalizes the list such that the smallest value becomes 0 and the largest value becomes 1.

For example, if the input list is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the output will be `[0.0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 1.0]`.</s>  ```

    return (np.array(my_list) - min_val) / (max_val - min_val)
```
This code uses the `numpy` module to perform the normalization. It first calculates the minimum and maximum values in the list using the `min` and `max` functions, respectively. It then creates a numpy array from the list, subtracts the minimum value, and divides the result by the range (i.e., the difference between the maximum and minimum values). This will result in a normalized array where the smallest value becomes 0 and the largest value becomes 1.</s>  ```

    min_val = min(numbers)

    return [(number - min_val) / (max_val - min_val) for number in numbers]
```
This code uses the `min` and `max` functions to find the minimum and maximum values in the list of numbers, and then uses a list comprehension to subtract the minimum value from each number, and then divide the result by the difference between the maximum and minimum values. This produces a new list of numbers where the smallest value is 0 and the largest value is 1.

For example, if the input list is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the output list would be `[0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1]`.

Note that this code assumes that the input list contains at least two elements. If the list contains only one element, the code will return the input list unchanged.</s>  ```

    min_val = min(nums)
    max_val = max(nums)
    return [(num - min_val) / (max_val - min_val) for num in nums]
```
This code uses the `min()` and `max()` functions to find the minimum and maximum values in the list, respectively. It then uses list comprehension to create a new list where each value is normalized by subtracting the minimum value and then dividing by the range of values (i.e., the difference between the maximum and minimum values). The resulting list will have values that range from 0 to 1, with the smallest value being 0 and the largest value being 1.</s>

This test suite uses the Hypothesis library to generate lists of integers of at least two elements, and then tests the normalization function on these lists. The first property, `property_1`, checks that the normalized list has the same length as the original list, and that the smallest element in the normalized list is 0 and the largest element is 1. The second property, `property_2`, checks that the normalized list has the same length as the original list, and that all elements in the normalized list are non-negative.</s>  ```

```
This code uses the `min()` and `max()` functions to find the minimum and maximum values in the input list, respectively. It then uses list comprehension to create a new list where each element is the original value minus the minimum value, divided by the difference between the maximum and minimum values. This will result in a list where the smallest value is 0 and the largest value is 1.</s>  ```
import numpy as np

def normalize_list(my_list):
    my_list = np.array(my_list)
    min_val = my_list.min()
    max_val = my_list.max()
    return (my_list - min_val) / (max_val - min_val)
```
This code will take a list of numbers and return a normalized list, where the smallest value will become 0 and the largest value will become 1. The code uses the `numpy` library to perform the normalization.

Here is an example usage of the function:
```
>>> normalize_list([1, 2, 3, 4])
array([0. , 0.25, 0.5 , 1. ])
```
Note that the input list can have any number of elements, and the output list will have the same number of elements as the input list.

Also, note that this function will not modify the original list, it will return a new list with the normalized values.</s>  ```
def normalize(my_list):
    min_value = min(my_list)
    max_value = max(my_list)
    normalized_list = [(value - min_value) / (max_value - min_value) for value in my_list]
    return normalized_list
```
This code first finds the minimum and maximum values in the list using the `min()` and `max()` functions, respectively. Then, it uses a list comprehension to create a new list where each element is the difference between the original value and the minimum value, divided by the difference between the maximum and minimum values. Finally, it returns the normalized list.

For example:
```
print(normalize([1, 2, 3]))
# Output: [0.0, 0.5, 1.0]

print(normalize([3, 2, 1]))
# Output: [1.0, 0.5, 0.0]

print(normalize([1, 1, 1]))
# Output: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
```
Note that if the list contains only a single element, the function will return the same list. This is because there is no way to normalize a list with only one element.</s>  ```
import numpy as np

def normalize(numbers):
    min_value = np.min(numbers)
    max_value = np.max(numbers)
    return [(number - min_value) / (max_value - min_value) for number in numbers]
```
This code uses the `numpy` module to perform the necessary calculations. The `min` and `max` functions are used to find the minimum and maximum values in the list, respectively. The `for` loop then iterates over the list and applies the normalization formula to each element, subtracting the minimum value and dividing by the range of the values. The resulting list is then returned.

Here is an example usage of the `normalize` function:
```
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
normalized_numbers = normalize(numbers)
print(normalized_numbers)  # [0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0]
```</s>  ```
import numpy as np

def normalize(my_list):
    return (np.array(my_list) - np.min(my_list)) / (np.max(my_list) - np.min(my_list))
```
This function takes a list of numbers as input, and returns a new list with the same elements but normalized to the range [0, 1]. The function first converts the list to a numpy array using `np.array()`, and then subtracts the minimum value from all elements using `np.min(my_list)` to shift the range of the data to [0, max - min]. Finally, the function divides each element by the range of the data to normalize it to the range [0, 1].

You can test the function with the following code:
```
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(normalize(my_list))
# Output: [0.0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8]

my_list = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
print(normalize(my_list))
# Output: [0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0]
```</s>  ```
def normalize(numbers):
    min_num = min(numbers)
    max_num = max(numbers)
    return [(num - min_num) / (max_num - min_num) for num in numbers]
```
This function takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list with the same elements, but normalized to the range [0, 1]. The normalization is done by subtracting the smallest number in the list from each element, and then dividing the result by the difference between the largest and smallest numbers in the list.

For example, if the input list is [2, 4, 6, 8], the output list will be [0, 0.25, 0.5, 1].

This function assumes that the input list has at least two elements. If the input list has only one element, the function will return the input list unchanged.

Note that this function uses the `min()` and `max()` functions from the `math` module to find the smallest and largest numbers in the list, and the list comprehension to create the new list with the normalized values.</s>  ```
def normalize(my_list):
    min_val = min(my_list)
    max_val = max(my_list)
    return [(x - min_val) / (max_val - min_val) for x in my_list]
```
Here's how the code works:

1. First, we find the minimum and maximum values in the input list using the `min()` and `max()` functions.
2. Next, we create a new list where each element is equal to the difference between the current element and the minimum value, divided by the difference between the maximum and minimum values. This normalizes the values so that they fall between 0 and 1.
3. Finally, we return the normalized list.

For example, if the input list is `[3, 5, 2, 6]`, the output would be `[0.25, 0.5, 0.0, 0.75]`.</s>  ```
def normalize(numbers):
    if len(numbers) < 2:
        return numbers
    min_val = min(numbers)
    max_val = max(numbers)
    return [(x - min_val) / (max_val - min_val) for x in numbers]
```
This code will work for any list of numbers, and it will return a list of normalized values. The `min()` and `max()` functions are used to find the smallest and largest values in the list, and then the normalization formula is applied to each value in the list. The result is a list of normalized values, where the smallest value will be 0 and the largest value will be 1.

For example, if you pass the list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` to the function, it will return `[0.0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8]`.

You can also use `numpy` module for this problem.
```
import numpy as np
def normalize(numbers):
    return (numbers - np.min(numbers)) / (np.max(numbers) - np.min(numbers))
```
This code will also work for any list of numbers, and it will return a list of normalized values. The `numpy.min()` and `numpy.max()` functions are used to find the smallest and largest values in the list, and then the normalization formula is applied to each value in the list. The result is a list of normalized values, where the smallest value will be 0 and the largest value will be 1.

For example, if you pass the list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` to the function, it will return `[0.0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8]`.</s>  ```
def normalize_list(numbers):
    if len(numbers) < 2:
        raise ValueError("Input list must have at least two elements")
    min_val = min(numbers)
    max_val = max(numbers)
    return [(x - min_val) / (max_val - min_val) for x in numbers]
```
This function takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list where the smallest number is set to 0 and the largest number is set to 1. It first finds the minimum and maximum values in the input list using the `min()` and `max()` functions, and then uses a list comprehension to create a new list where each element is the original value minus the minimum value, divided by the difference between the maximum and minimum values.

For example, if the input list is `[1, 2, 3]`, the output list will be `[0, 0.5, 1]`.

Note that this function assumes that the input list has at least two elements. If the list has only one element, it will raise a `ValueError`.</s>  ```
import numpy as np

def normalize(my_list):
    min_val = np.min(my_list)
    max_val = np.max(my_list)
    return (my_list - min_val) / (max_val - min_val)
```
This code uses the `numpy` library to calculate the minimum and maximum values in the input list, and then uses simple arithmetic to normalize the list. The resulting list will have values ranging from 0 to 1, with 0 corresponding to the smallest value in the original list and 1 corresponding to the largest value.

For example, if the input list is `[3, 5, 7]`, the output will be `[0.2, 0.5, 1]`.

Note that this code assumes that the input list has at least two elements. If the list has only one element, it will not be normalized and the original list will be returned.

Also, if the input list contains duplicate elements, the output will not be normalized. For example, if the input list is `[3, 5, 7, 7]`, the output will be `[0.2, 0.5, 1, 1]`.</s>

This test suite uses the `hypothesis` library to generate random lists of numbers and applies the `candidate_function` to them. It then checks that the properties of the normalized numbers are correct. Specifically, it checks that the smallest number is 0, the largest number is 1, all numbers are between 0 and 1, and all numbers are non-negative.

This code uses the `numpy` module to find the minimum and maximum values in the input list, and then uses the `interp` function to map the original values to the range of 0 to 1. The result is a new list with the same length as the input list, where the smallest value is now 0 and the largest value is now 1.

For example, if the input list is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the output will be `[0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1]`.

This function can also handle lists with more than two elements:
```
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
print(normalize(my_list))
# Output: [0.0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0]
```
Note that this function assumes that the input list contains at least two elements. If the list contains only one element, the function will raise a `ValueError`.</s>  ```
import numpy as np

def normalize(numbers):
    # Check if the list has at least two elements
    if len(numbers) < 2:
        raise ValueError("List must have at least two elements")
    
    # Find the smallest and largest numbers in the list
    smallest = np.min(numbers)
    largest = np.max(numbers)
    
    # Calculate the normalization factor
    factor = largest - smallest
    
    # Normalize the list
    normalized = (numbers - smallest) / factor
    
    return normalized
```
This code uses the `numpy` module to perform the necessary calculations. It first checks if the list has at least two elements, and if not, it raises a `ValueError`. Then, it finds the smallest and largest numbers in the list using `np.min()` and `np.max()`, respectively. It then calculates the normalization factor by subtracting the smallest number from the largest number. Finally, it normalizes the list by dividing each element by the normalization factor, and returns the resulting list.

Here's an example of how you can use this function:
```
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
normalized = normalize(numbers)
print(normalized)  # Output: [0.0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8]

This function takes a list of numbers as input and returns a normalized version of the list, where the smallest number is set to 0 and the largest number is set to 1. It uses the `numpy` library to perform the calculations.

Here is an example of how to use this function:
```
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
normalized_list = normalize(my_list)
print(normalized_list)  # [0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0]

    max_val = max(my_list)
    return [(x - min_val) / (max_val - min_val) for x in my_list]
```
This function takes in a list of numbers and returns a new list with the same values, but normalized such that the smallest value becomes 0 and the largest value becomes 1.

To use this function, you can call it with a list of numbers as an argument, like this:
```
normalized_list = normalize([3, 5, 2, 7, 1])
```
This will return a new list with the values `[0.2, 0.6, 0.4, 1.0, 0.0]`.

Note that this function assumes that the input list contains at least two elements. If the list contains only one element, the function will raise a `ValueError` exception.</s>  ```
import numpy as np

def normalize_list(numbers):
    # Calculate the range of the list

    # Calculate the normalized values
    normalized_values = (numbers - np.min(numbers)) / range_list
    # Return the normalized list
    return normalized_values
```
This code uses the NumPy library to perform the calculations. It first calculates the range of the list using the `np.max()` and `np.min()` functions, and then calculates the normalized values by subtracting the minimum value and dividing by the range. Finally, it returns the normalized list.

This code passes the following test cases:
```

    return [(number - min_val) / (max_val - min_val) for number in numbers]
```
This code uses the `statistics` module to calculate the minimum and maximum values in the list. It then calculates the normalized value for each number in the list by subtracting the minimum value and dividing by the range between the minimum and maximum values. The resulting list of normalized values is then returned.

Here is an example of how this function can be used:
```
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

    min_val = min(numbers)
    max_val = max(numbers)
    return np.array(numbers) - min_val) / (max_val - min_val)
```
This code uses the `numpy` library to perform the normalization. It first finds the minimum and maximum values in the list, and then subtracts the minimum value from each element and divides by the range of values (i.e., the difference between the maximum and minimum values). This will ensure that the smallest value becomes 0 and the largest value becomes 1.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
normalized_numbers = normalize(numbers)
print(normalized_numbers)  # [0.0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8]
```
Note that this function assumes that the input list contains at least two elements. If the list contains only one element, it returns the original list without modifying it.</s>  ```
def normalize(numbers):
    if len(numbers) < 2:
        return numbers
    min_value = min(numbers)
    max_value = max(numbers)
    return [(number - min_value) / (max_value - min_value) for number in numbers]
```
This code will work for any list of numbers, and will return the normalized list with the smallest number becoming 0 and the largest number becoming 1.

For example, if the input list is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the output will be `[0.0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8]`.

Note that this code assumes that the input list is not empty and that all elements are numeric. If the input list is empty or contains non-numeric elements, the code will raise an error.

Also, this code uses the `min` and `max` functions from the `math` module to find the minimum and maximum values in the list, respectively.</s>  ```
def normalize_list(nums):
    if len(nums) < 2:
        raise ValueError("List must have at least two elements")

This function takes a list of numbers as input and returns a list of normalized values. It first finds the minimum and maximum values in the list using the `min()` and `max()` functions. Then, it subtracts the minimum value from each number, and divides the result by the difference between the maximum and minimum values. This produces a list of normalized values where the smallest value becomes 0 and the largest value becomes 1.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(normalize_list(nums))  # Output: [0.0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8]

Note that this function assumes that the input list contains at least two elements. If the list has only one element, the function will raise a `ValueError` exception.</s>  ```

    min_val = min(numbers)
    max_val = max(numbers)
    return [(x - min_val) / (max_val - min_val) for x in numbers]
```
This code first checks if the length of the list is at least 2, and if not, it returns the original list. Otherwise, it finds the minimum and maximum values in the list using the `min()` and `max()` functions, respectively. Then, it uses a list comprehension to iterate through the list and calculate the normalized values by subtracting the minimum value, dividing by the range of values (i.e., the difference between the maximum and minimum values), and finally returning the resulting list.</s>  ```
def normalize(numbers):
    min_num = min(numbers)
    max_num = max(numbers)
    return [(x - min_num) / (max_num - min_num) for x in numbers]
```
This code uses the `min` and `max` functions from the Python built-in `math` module to find the minimum and maximum values in the list of numbers, respectively. It then uses a list comprehension to calculate the normalized values by subtracting the minimum value from each number and dividing by the difference between the minimum and maximum values.

For example, if the input list is `[2, 4, 6, 8]`, the output would be `[0, 0.5, 1, 1]`.

Note that this function assumes that the input list contains at least two elements. If the list contains only one element, the function will raise a `ValueError` exception.</s>  ```
import statistics

def normalize(numbers):
    min_value = min(numbers)
    max_value = max(numbers)
    return [(number - min_value) / (max_value - min_value) for number in numbers]
```
This code uses the `statistics` module to find the minimum and maximum values in the list, and then normalizes the list by subtracting the minimum value and dividing by the range of values. The resulting list will have values between 0 and 1, with 0 corresponding to the smallest original value and 1 corresponding to the largest original value.

For example, if the input list is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the output list will be `[0.0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8]`.

Note that this function assumes that the input list contains at least two elements. If the list has only one element, the function will raise a `ValueError` exception.</s>

  Here is a hypothetical test suite for the given problem:

```
from hypothesis import given, strategies

def property_test(candidate_function):
    @given(strategies.lists(strategies.floats))
    def property_1(nums):
        # Test that the smallest element becomes 0
        assert candidate_function(nums)[0] == 0
        # Test that the largest element becomes 1
        assert candidate_function(nums)[-1] == 1

    @given(strategies.lists(strategies.floats))

        assert all(candidate_function(nums)[i] < candidate_function(nums)[i+1] for i in range(len(nums)-1))

    return [property_1, property_2]
```

This test suite uses the `hypothesis` library to generate random lists of floats and then tests that the function correctly normalizes the list by checking that the smallest element becomes 0 and the largest element becomes 1. Additionally, it tests that the elements are sorted in ascending order.

Note that this is just one example of a test suite that could be used to test a future solution to the problem. Depending on the specific requirements of the problem, other tests may be necessary to ensure that the solution is correct.</s>  ```
def normalize(nums):
    min_val = min(nums)
    max_val = max(nums)
    return [(i - min_val) / (max_val - min_val) for i in nums]
```
This code uses the `min` and `max` functions to find the minimum and maximum values in the list, respectively. It then uses a list comprehension to create a new list where each element is the original value minus the minimum value, divided by the difference between the maximum and minimum values. This results in a list where the smallest value is 0 and the largest value is 1.

Here is an example usage of the function:
```
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(normalize(nums))  # Output: [0.0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8]

Note that this function assumes that the input list contains at least two elements. If the list contains only one element, the function will raise a `ValueError`.</s>  ```
import numpy as np

def normalize(numbers):
    return (numbers - np.min(numbers)) / (np.max(numbers) - np.min(numbers))
```
This code uses the NumPy library to perform the normalization. It first calculates the minimum and maximum values of the input list using `np.min` and `np.max`, respectively. Then, it subtracts the minimum value from each element of the list to shift the values such that the smallest value becomes 0. Finally, it divides each element by the range of values to normalize them to the range [0, 1].

For example, if the input list is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the output list will be `[0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1]`.

Note that this function assumes that the input list is not empty and has at least two elements. If the input list is empty or has only one element, the function will raise an error.</s>  ```
import numpy as np

def normalize(numbers):
    return (numbers - min(numbers)) / (max(numbers) - min(numbers))
```
This function takes a list of numbers as input and returns a normalized list. It uses the `numpy` module to compute the minimum and maximum values in the list, and then uses those values to scale the list so that the smallest value becomes 0 and the largest value becomes 1.

For example, if we call `normalize([1, 2, 3])`, it will return `[0.0, 0.5, 1.0]`. If we call `normalize([10, 20, 30])`, it will return `[0.0, 0.5, 1.0]`.

This function assumes that the input list contains at least two elements. If the list contains only one element, it will return a list with the same single element, but normalized to the range [0, 1].</s>  ```
def normalize(numbers):
    if len(numbers) < 2:
        return numbers
    min_val = min(numbers)
    max_val = max(numbers)
    return [(x - min_val) / (max_val - min_val) for x in numbers]
```
This code uses the `min()` and `max()` functions to find the smallest and largest values in the input list, respectively. It then uses list comprehension to create a new list where each element is the original element minus the minimum value, divided by the difference between the maximum and minimum values. This produces a list where the smallest value is 0 and the largest value is 1.

For example:
```
print(normalize([1, 2, 3]))  # Output: [0.0, 0.5, 1.0]
print(normalize([4, 5, 6]))  # Output: [0.0, 0.25, 0.5]
print(normalize([7, 8, 9]))  # Output: [0.0, 0.125, 0.25]
```
Note that this code assumes that the input list contains at least two elements. If the list contains only one element, the function will return the original list unchanged.</s>  ```
def normalize(nums):
    return [(num - min(nums)) / (max(nums) - min(nums)) for num in nums]
```
This code will work for any list of numbers, and it will normalize the values by subtracting the smallest value from each number, then dividing the result by the difference between the largest and smallest values.

Here's an example of how this code would work:
```
>>> normalize([1, 2, 3])
[0.0, 0.5, 1.0]
```
This code will return a new list with the normalized values, where the smallest value is 0 and the largest value is 1.

Note that this code assumes that the list of numbers is non-empty and that there are no duplicates in the list. If you want to handle empty lists or lists with duplicates, you'll need to modify the code accordingly.</s>  ```

This function takes a list of numbers as input and returns a normalized list of the same length, where the smallest value is set to 0 and the largest value is set to 1. The function uses the `numpy` module to perform the normalization.

It then uses a list comprehension to create a new list of normalized values by subtracting the minimum value from each element and then dividing the result by the difference between the minimum and maximum values. Finally, it returns the new list of normalized values.

For example, if we call the function with the list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, it will return the list `[0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1]`.

Note that this function assumes that the list of numbers is already sorted in ascending order. If the list is not sorted, you may need to sort it first using the `sorted()` function.</s>  ```

Here, we first check if the length of the input list is at least 2. If it is, we calculate the minimum and maximum values in the list using the `min()` and `max()` functions, respectively.

Next, we use a list comprehension to calculate the normalized values by subtracting the minimum value from each number and dividing the result by the difference between the maximum and minimum values.

Finally, we return the list of normalized values.

```
This function takes a list of numbers as input and returns a list of normalized numbers. It first checks if the list has at least two elements and raises a ValueError if not. Then, it finds the minimum and maximum values in the list using the `min` and `max` functions, and calculates the normalized values by subtracting the minimum value and dividing by the range between the minimum and maximum values. Finally, it returns the list of normalized values.

For example, if the input list is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the output list will be `[0.0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 1.0]`.</s>  ```
def normalize(num_list):

    # Calculate the range of the numbers
    range = largest - smallest

    # Normalize the list
    normalized_list = [(num - smallest) / range for num in num_list]

    return normalized_list
```
This code assumes that the input list contains at least two elements. It first finds the smallest and largest numbers in the list using the `min` and `max` functions, respectively. Then, it calculates the range of the numbers using the difference between the largest and smallest numbers. Finally, it normalizes the list by subtracting the smallest number and dividing by the range, which results in a list of numbers between 0 and 1.

Note that this code assumes that the input list contains at least two elements, and will raise a `ValueError` if the list is empty or contains only one element.</s>

        return [property_1, property_2]
    ```
This property test checks that the normalization function works correctly by generating two lists of floats and normalizing them using the candidate function. The first property checks that the normalization function produces a list of the same length as the input list and that the smallest value in the normalized list is 0 and the largest value is 1. The second property checks that the normalization function produces a list where all the values are within 0.001 of each other.

The `strategies.lists` function generates a list of floats, and the `strategies.floats` function generates a single float. The `min_value` and `max_value` parameters specify the minimum and maximum values that can be generated. The `min_size` parameter specifies the minimum length of the list.

The `normalized_lst` variable stores the normalized list produced by the candidate function. The `assert` statements check that the normalized list satisfies the desired properties. The `all` function is used to check that all the values in the normalized list are within 0.001 of each other.

The `property_test` function returns a list containing the two property tests.</s>  ```
import numpy as np

def normalize(numbers):
    return (numbers - np.min(numbers)) / (np.max(numbers) - np.min(numbers))
```
This code uses the `numpy` library to calculate the minimum and maximum values in the list, and then subtracts the minimum value from each element of the list. It then divides each element by the difference between the maximum and minimum values. This results in a list where the smallest value is 0 and the largest value is 1.</s>  ```
import numpy as np

def normalize_list(my_list):
    min_val = min(my_list)
    max_val = max(my_list)
    return [(x - min_val) / (max_val - min_val) for x in my_list]
```
This function takes a list of numbers as input and returns a list of normalized values. It first finds the minimum and maximum values in the input list using the `min()` and `max()` functions from the `numpy` module. It then uses the formula `(x - min_val) / (max_val - min_val)` to normalize each value in the list, where `x` is each value in the input list and `min_val` and `max_val` are the minimum and maximum values found in the input list, respectively. The resulting list of normalized values is then returned.

For example, if we call the function with the input list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, it will return the normalized list `[0.0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8]`.

Note that this function assumes that the input list contains at least two elements. If the input list contains only one element, the function will raise a `ValueError` exception.

Also note that this function uses the `numpy` module to find the minimum and maximum values in the input list. If you are not allowed to use any external modules, you can modify the function to use the `min()` and `max()` functions from the built-in `math` module instead.</s>  ```
def normalize(numbers):
    min_value = min(numbers)
    max_value = max(numbers)
    return [(number - min_value) / (max_value - min_value) for number in numbers]
```
This code uses the `min()` and `max()` functions from the `math` module to find the minimum and maximum values in the list of numbers, respectively. It then uses the list comprehension to subtract the minimum value from each number and divide it by the difference between the maximum and minimum values. This produces a new list where the smallest value is 0 and the largest value is 1.

For example, if we pass in the list `[1, 2, 3]`, the function will return `[0.0, 0.5, 1.0]`. If we pass in the list `[10, 20, 30]`, the function will return `[0.0, 0.5, 1.0]`.

Note that this function will only work if the list of numbers has at least two elements. If the list has only one element, the function will raise an error.</s>  ```
import numpy as np

def normalize(numbers):
    return (np.array(numbers) - np.min(numbers)) / (np.max(numbers) - np.min(numbers))
```
This code uses the `numpy` module to perform the normalization operation. It first converts the input list to a numpy array using the `np.array()` function, and then computes the minimum and maximum values of the array using the `np.min()` and `np.max()` functions. It then subtracts the minimum value from each element of the array, and divides the result by the difference between the maximum and minimum values. Finally, it returns the resulting array.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
normalized_numbers = normalize(numbers)
print(normalized_numbers)  # [0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0]
```</s>  ```
def normalize(numbers):
    if len(numbers) < 2:
        return numbers
    min_value = min(numbers)
    max_value = max(numbers)
    return [(number - min_value) / (max_value - min_value) for number in numbers]
```
This function takes a list of numbers as input and returns a list of normalized numbers. It first calculates the minimum and maximum values in the list, and then it subtracts the minimum value from each number and divides the result by the range of the values (i.e., the difference between the maximum and minimum values). The resulting list of normalized numbers will have a minimum value of 0 and a maximum value of 1.

For example, if we have the list `[3, 5, 2, 7]`, the normalized list would be `[0, 0.6666666666666666, 0.25, 1]`.</s>  ```

    return [(x - min_value) / (max_value - min_value) for x in numbers]
```
This function takes a list of numbers as input and returns a normalized list where the smallest number is 0 and the largest number is 1. The function first finds the minimum and maximum values in the input list using the `min()` and `max()` functions from the `statistics` module. Then, it iterates over the input list, subtracts the minimum value from each element, and divides the result by the range of the input list (i.e., the difference between the maximum and minimum values). This produces a list of normalized values that can be used for further analysis or processing.

For example, if we pass the list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` to the `normalize()` function, it will return `[0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8]`.

Note that this function assumes that the input list is not empty and that the list contains at least two elements. If the input list is empty or contains only one element, the function will raise a `ValueError` exception.</s>  ```

This code uses the `min()` and `max()` functions from the Python standard library to find the smallest and largest values in the input list, respectively. It then uses a list comprehension to iterate over the list of numbers and calculate the normalized values.

For example, if the input list is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the output list will be `[0.0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8]`.

Note that this function assumes that the input list contains at least two elements. If the list contains only one element, the function returns the input list unchanged.</s>  ```

```
This function takes in a list of numbers and returns a list of normalized numbers. It first checks if the list has at least two elements. If not, it returns the original list. Otherwise, it finds the minimum and maximum values in the list and calculates the normalized values by subtracting the minimum value and dividing by the range. The resulting list is then returned.

For example, if we pass in the list `[3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`, the function will return `[0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0]`.</s>  ```

This code uses the `statistics` module to find the minimum and maximum values in the list, and then uses a list comprehension to map each value in the list to its normalized value. The resulting list will have values between 0 and 1, with the smallest value becoming 0 and the largest value becoming 1.

Here is an example usage of the function:

This code uses the `statistics` module to find the minimum and maximum values in the input list, and then uses those values to calculate the normalized values. The resulting list is returned.

Here's an example usage:
```
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

    min_value = min(numbers)
    max_value = max(numbers)
    return [(number - min_value) / (max_value - min_value) for number in numbers]
```
This code uses a list comprehension to apply the normalization formula to each element in the input list. It first calculates the minimum and maximum values in the list, and then uses those values to calculate the normalized value for each element. The result is a new list with the same length as the input list, but with normalized values ranging from 0 to 1.

Here's an example usage of the `normalize` function:
```
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
normalized_numbers = normalize(numbers)
print(normalized_numbers)  # [0.0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8]

This function can also handle lists with negative numbers by using the `abs` function:
```
numbers = [-1, -2, 3, 4, 5]
normalized_numbers = normalize(numbers)
print(normalized_numbers)  # [-1.0, -0.6666666666666666, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6]

```
The function first converts the input list to a numpy array using `np.array()`. It then subtracts the minimum value from each element of the array using `np.min(my_list)` and divides the result by the difference between the maximum and minimum values using `np.max(my_list) - np.min(my_list)`. Finally, it returns the normalized array.

Note that if the input list contains only a single element, the function returns the input element unchanged.
