This test suite includes five tests for the `add_two_numbers` function. Each test has an input and an output. The input consists of two numbers, and the output is the expected sum of the two numbers. The first two tests test the function with positive numbers, the third test tests the function with floating-point numbers, the fourth test tests the function with mixed types, and the fifth test tests the function with invalid input.</s>  ```
def add(a, b):
    return a + b
```
This code uses the `+` operator to add two numbers. It takes two arguments, `a` and `b`, and returns their sum.

Here's an example of how this code can be used:
```
print(add(2, 3))  # prints 5
```
This code adds the numbers 2 and 3, and prints the result (5) to the console.</s>  ```
def add(a, b):
    return a + b
```
This function takes two integer arguments `a` and `b` and returns their sum. The `+` operator is used to perform addition.

Here are some examples of how the function can be used:
```
print(add(3, 4))  # Output: 7
print(add(5, 6))  # Output: 11
print(add(10, 2))  # Output: 12
```
This function can also be used with floating-point numbers:
```
print(add(3.5, 4.5))  # Output: 8
print(add(5.6, 6.7))  # Output: 12.3
print(add(10.2, 2.3))  # Output: 12.5
```
Note that the `+` operator can also be used with strings, but it will concatenate them rather than adding them. For example:
```
print(add("hello", "world"))  # Output: "helloworld"
```</s>  ```
def add(a, b):
    return a + b
```
This function takes two integers as input and returns their sum. It does not use any modules and is a simple implementation of the addition operation.

Here is an example of how you can use this function:
```
print(add(3, 4))  # Output: 7
```
This code will call the `add` function with the arguments `3` and `4`, and print the result, which is `7`.</s>  ```
def add(a, b):
    return a + b
```
This code defines a function `add` that takes two arguments `a` and `b` and returns their sum. The `+` operator is used to add the two numbers together.

Here's an example of how to use the function:
```
print(add(3, 5))  # prints 8
```
This code calls the `add` function with the arguments `3` and `5` and prints the result, which is `8`.</s>  ```
def add_numbers(a, b):
    return a + b
```
This code defines a function called `add_numbers` that takes two arguments, `a` and `b`, and returns their sum. The function uses the `+` operator to perform the addition operation.

Here's an example usage of the `add_numbers` function:
```
print(add_numbers(3, 5))  # Output: 8
```
This code calls the `add_numbers` function with the arguments `3` and `5`, and then prints the result to the console. The output is `8`, which is the sum of `3` and `5`.

Note that this code only works for integer arguments. If you want to add floating-point numbers, you can use the `float` function to convert them to floating-point numbers before adding them. For example:
```
def add_numbers(a, b):
    return float(a) + float(b)
```
This code defines a function called `add_numbers` that takes two arguments, `a` and `b`, and returns their sum. The function uses the `float` function to convert `a` and `b` to floating-point numbers before adding them.

Here's an example usage of the `add_numbers` function:
```
print(add_numbers(3.5, 5.7))  # Output: 9.2
```
This code calls the `add_numbers` function with the arguments `3.5` and `5.7`, and then prints the result to the console. The output is `9.2`, which is the sum of `3.5` and `5.7`.</s>  ```
def add_numbers(num1, num2):
    return num1 + num2
```
This code will add two numbers and return the sum. The `+` operator is used to add the two numbers.

Here is an example of how this function can be used:
```
>>> add_numbers(3, 5)
8
```
This will add the two numbers `3` and `5` and return the sum, which is `8`.

This function can be used to add any two numbers, and it will return the sum.

Note: This function does not handle any errors or edge cases, it only adds two numbers and returns the sum.</s>  ```
def add_numbers(a, b):
    return a + b
```
This code defines a function called `add_numbers` that takes two arguments, `a` and `b`, and returns their sum. The `return` statement specifies the value that the function will return when it is called.

Here is an example of how you can use this function:
```
>>> add_numbers(3, 5)
8
```
This will call the `add_numbers` function with the arguments `3` and `5`, and the function will return the sum of those two numbers, which is `8`.

Note that this function does not use any modules, but it is a simple example of a function that takes two arguments and returns their sum.</s>  ```
def add(a, b):
    return a + b
```
This code defines a function `add` that takes two arguments `a` and `b` and returns their sum. It is a simple function that can be used to add two numbers.

Here's an example of how the function can be used:
```
>>> add(3, 4)
7
```
This code calls the `add` function with the arguments `3` and `4`, and the function returns the result `7`.</s>  ```
def add_numbers(num1, num2):
    return num1 + num2
```
This code will take two numbers as input and return the sum of the two numbers.

For example:
```
>>> add_numbers(3, 5)
8
```</s>  ```
def add(a, b):
    return a + b
```
This code defines a function `add` that takes two arguments `a` and `b` and returns their sum. The `+` operator is used to perform the addition.

To test the function, you can use the following code:
```
print(add(3, 4))  # should print 7
print(add(5, 6))  # should print 11
```
This code calls the `add` function with two different sets of arguments and prints the results. The output should be `7` and `11`.</s>
