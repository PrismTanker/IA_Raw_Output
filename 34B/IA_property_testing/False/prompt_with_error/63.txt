Prompt: The FibFib number sequence is a sequence similar to the Fibbonacci sequnece that's defined as follows:
    fibfib(0) == 0
    fibfib(1) == 0
    fibfib(2) == 1
    fibfib(n) == fibfib(n-1) + fibfib(n-2) + fibfib(n-n).
    Please write a function to efficiently compute the n-th element of the fibfib number sequence.
-------------------
  Here is a test suite using the Hypothesis library to test a future solution for the FibFib number sequence problem:
```
from hypothesis import given, strategies

def property_test(candidate_function):
    @given(strategies.integers(min_value=0))
    def property_1(n):
        assert candidate_function(n) == fibfib(n)

    @given(strategies.integers(min_value=0))
    def property_2(n):
        assert candidate_function(n) == fibfib(n-1) + fibfib(n-2) + fibfib(n-n)

    return [property_1, property_2]
```
This test suite defines two properties:

1. `property_1` tests that the candidate function returns the same value as the `fibfib` function for all positive integers.
2. `property_2` tests that the candidate function returns the sum of the previous two FibFib numbers plus the current FibFib number for all positive integers.

These properties test the requirements of the problem and can be used to verify the correctness of a future solution.</s>  Here is one possible solution:
```
def fibfib(n):
    if n <= 2:
        return 0
    else:
        a = 0
        b = 0
        c = 1
        for i in range(3, n+1):
            a, b, c = b, c, a + b + c
        return c
```
This solution uses a simple iterative approach to compute the n-th element of the fibfib sequence. It starts with the initial values a = 0, b = 0, and c = 1, and then iteratively updates these values using the recurrence relation fibfib(n) = fibfib(n-1) + fibfib(n-2) + fibfib(n-n). The final value of c is the n-th element of the fibfib sequence.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n), since the loop iterates n-3 times, and each iteration takes constant time.

Here is an example usage of the function:
```
print(fibfib(10)) # Output: 55
```
This will print the 10-th element of the fibfib sequence, which is 55.</s>  ```
def fibfib(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return 0
    elif n == 2:
        return 1
    else:
        return fibfib(n-1) + fibfib(n-2) + fibfib(n-n)
```
This function uses a recursive approach to compute the n-th element of the fibfib number sequence. It has a time complexity of O(2^n), which is exponential. However, it is a simple and straightforward implementation.

If you need a more efficient solution, you can use the following approach:
```
def fibfib(n):
    a, b = 0, 1
    for _ in range(n-1):
        a, b = b, a + b
    return a
```
This function uses a loop to compute the n-th element of the fibfib number sequence. It has a time complexity of O(n), which is linear.

You can also use the following approach:
```
def fibfib(n):
    return int(round(((1 + 5**0.5) / 2)**n / 5**0.5))
```
This function uses the formula for the fibfib number sequence to compute the n-th element directly. It has a time complexity of O(1), which is constant. However, it is not as straightforward to understand as the previous approaches.</s>  ```
def fibfib(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return 0
    elif n == 2:
        return 1
    else:
        return fibfib(n-1) + fibfib(n-2) + fibfib(n-n)
```
This function uses a recursive approach to compute the n-th element of the fibfib number sequence. It first checks if n is less than or equal to 1, in which case the result is 0. If n is 2, the result is 1. Otherwise, it uses the recurrence relation to compute the result.

Here's an example of how this function works:

fibfib(5) = fibfib(4) + fibfib(3) + fibfib(2)
= fibfib(3) + fibfib(2) + fibfib(1) + fibfib(0)
= fibfib(2) + fibfib(1) + fibfib(0) + fibfib(0)
= fibfib(1) + fibfib(0) + fibfib(0)
= fibfib(0) + fibfib(0)
= 0

So fibfib(5) is 0.

This function is efficient because it only computes each element of the sequence once and stores the results in memory, so the time complexity is O(n).</s>  ```
def fibfib(n):
    if n <= 2:
        return 0
    else:
        return fibfib(n-1) + fibfib(n-2) + fibfib(n-n)
```
This function uses a recursive approach to calculate the n-th element of the FibFib number sequence. It has a time complexity of O(2^n), which means that it is not efficient for large values of n.

To make the function more efficient, we can use memoization to store the results of the previous calculations and avoid recalculating them. Here's an example of how to do that:
```
memo = {0: 0, 1: 0, 2: 1}

def fibfib(n):
    if n in memo:
        return memo[n]
    else:
        result = fibfib(n-1) + fibfib(n-2) + fibfib(n-n)
        memo[n] = result
        return result
```
This function uses a dictionary to store the results of previous calculations, and it only calculates the n-th element once and stores the result in the dictionary. This way, it avoids recalculating the same value multiple times, which makes it much more efficient for large values of n.</s>  Here's a solution that uses memoization to efficiently compute the n-th element of the fibfib number sequence:
```
def fibfib(n):
    memo = {0: 0, 1: 0, 2: 1}
    def _fibfib(n):
        if n in memo:
            return memo[n]
        else:
            result = _fibfib(n-1) + _fibfib(n-2) + _fibfib(n-n)
            memo[n] = result
            return result
    return _fibfib(n)
```
The `fibfib` function takes an integer `n` as input and returns the n-th element of the fibfib number sequence. The function uses a memoization technique to store the results of previously computed values, so that they can be reused instead of recomputed.

The `memo` dictionary is used to store the results of previously computed values of `fibfib`. The keys of the dictionary are the values of `n` that have been computed, and the values are the corresponding results.

The `_fibfib` function is a recursive function that computes the n-th element of the fibfib number sequence. It takes an integer `n` as input and returns the result. The function uses the memoization technique to store the results of previously computed values. If the result of `fibfib(n)` is already stored in the `memo` dictionary, it is returned directly. Otherwise, the function computes the result using the recursive formula and stores it in the `memo` dictionary.

The `fibfib` function is the wrapper function that calls the `_fibfib` function with the input `n`. It returns the result of the `_fibfib` function.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n) because the `_fibfib` function is called at most once for each value of `n` between 0 and `n`, and the computation of each value takes constant time. The space complexity is O(n) because the `memo` dictionary stores at most `n` values.</s>  ```
def fibfib(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return 0
    if n == 2:
        return 1
    return fibfib(n-1) + fibfib(n-2) + fibfib(n-n)
```
This function uses a recursive approach to calculate the n-th element of the fibfib number sequence. The base cases are fibfib(0) = 0, fibfib(1) = 0, and fibfib(2) = 1. For larger values of n, the function calls itself recursively to calculate the n-th element based on the recursive definition of the fibfib sequence.

It's worth noting that this function is not efficient for large values of n, as it has a time complexity of O(2^n). A more efficient approach would be to use dynamic programming or memoization to store previously calculated values and avoid redundant calculations.</s>  ```
def fibfib(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return 0
    elif n == 2:
        return 1
    else:
        return fibfib(n-1) + fibfib(n-2) + fibfib(n-n)
```
Note that this implementation uses a recursive approach, which may not be the most efficient for larger values of `n`. A more efficient implementation could use memoization or dynamic programming to avoid recomputing the same values multiple times.</s>  ```
def fibfib(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return 0
    elif n == 2:
        return 1
    else:
        return fibfib(n-1) + fibfib(n-2) + fibfib(n-n)
```
This function uses the recurrence relation defined in the problem to compute the n-th element of the fibfib number sequence. It first checks if n is less than or equal to 1, in which case the result is 0. If n is 2, the result is 1. Otherwise, it uses the recurrence relation to compute the result.

Note that this function is not efficient, as it has a time complexity of O(2^n), which means that it will become very slow for large values of n. To make it more efficient, you can use memoization or dynamic programming to store the results of previously computed values and avoid redundant computations.</s>  ```
def fibfib(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return 0
    elif n == 2:
        return 1
    else:
        return fibfib(n-1) + fibfib(n-2) + fibfib(n-n)
```
This function uses a recursive approach to compute the n-th element of the fibfib number sequence. It has a time complexity of O(2^n), which is not efficient for large values of n.

Here is a more efficient implementation using dynamic programming:
```
def fibfib(n):
    memo = [0, 0, 1]
    for i in range(3, n+1):
        memo.append(memo[i-1] + memo[i-2] + memo[i-i])
    return memo[n]
```
This function uses a memoization technique to store the values of previously computed fibfib numbers, which reduces the time complexity to O(n).</s>  ```
def fibfib(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return 0
    if n == 2:
        return 1
    return fibfib(n-1) + fibfib(n-2) + fibfib(n-n)
```
This function uses a recursive approach to calculate the n-th element of the Fibfib number sequence. It starts by checking the base cases where n is 0 or 1, and returns 0 for both. For n = 2, it returns 1. For n > 2, it calculates the n-th element by adding the (n-1)th, (n-2)th, and (n-n)th elements.

This solution is efficient because it only calculates each element once and avoids unnecessary calculations. It also uses a simple and intuitive recursive approach that is easy to understand.

Note that this solution assumes that the input n is a positive integer. If n can be negative or a floating-point number, additional checks and handling may be required.</s>
