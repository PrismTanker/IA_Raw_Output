Prompt: Return n-th Fibonacci number.
-------------------
  Here is a test suite for a future solution to the problem of returning the n-th Fibonacci number:
```
from hypothesis import given, strategies

def property_test(candidate_function) -> None:
    @given(strategies.integers(min_value=0))
    def property_1(n):
        assert candidate_function(n) == fibonacci_sequence[n]

    @given(strategies.integers(min_value=0, max_value=10))
    def property_2(n):
        assert candidate_function(n) == fibonacci_sequence[n]

    return [property_1, property_2]
```
This test suite uses the Hypothesis library to generate property tests for the candidate function. The two tests are:

1. `property_1`: This test checks that the candidate function returns the correct value for the n-th Fibonacci number, given a valid input `n`.
2. `property_2`: This test checks that the candidate function returns the correct value for the n-th Fibonacci number, given a valid input `n` that is less than or equal to 10.

The `fibonacci_sequence` variable is a list of the first 10 Fibonacci numbers, which is used to compare the output of the candidate function with the correct value.

Note that this is just an example test suite, and you may need to modify it to test other properties of the candidate function.</s>  Here is a Python function that returns the n-th Fibonacci number using the recursive formula:
```
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
```
This function uses the recursive formula for the Fibonacci sequence, which states that the n-th Fibonacci number is the sum of the (n-1)-th and (n-2)-th Fibonacci numbers. The function has a base case when `n <= 1`, in which case it returns the number itself. Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with `n-1` and `n-2` as arguments, and adds the results together to get the n-th Fibonacci number.

To use this function, simply call it with the number you want to compute the Fibonacci number for, like this:
```
print(fibonacci(5))  # prints 5
print(fibonacci(10))  # prints 55
print(fibonacci(20))  # prints 6765
```
This will print the n-th Fibonacci number for the given value of `n`.</s>  ```
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
```
This code uses a recursive approach to calculate the n-th Fibonacci number. The base case is when n is 0 or 1, in which case the answer is the same. Otherwise, the answer is the sum of the (n-1)st and (n-2)nd Fibonacci numbers.

This code is efficient because it uses memoization to store the results of previous calculations, so that they can be reused when the same number is encountered again. This avoids the need to recalculate the same values multiple times, which can save a lot of time and memory.</s>  ```
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
```
This code uses the recursive approach to solve the problem. The function takes in the value of n, and if n is 1 or 2, it returns the value of n. Otherwise, it calls itself with n-1 and n-2 as arguments, and adds the results together to return the n-th Fibonacci number.

It's worth noting that this solution is not optimized for performance, as it has a time complexity of O(2^n) and a space complexity of O(n). However, it is a simple and easy-to-understand solution that meets the constraints of the problem.</s>  To return the n-th Fibonacci number using a recursive approach, you can use the following code:
```
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
```
This code uses a recursive function to calculate the n-th Fibonacci number by calling itself with the parameters n-1 and n-2. The base case is when n is 1 or 2, in which case the function simply returns the number itself.

To use this code, simply call the `fibonacci` function with the desired value of `n`:
```
print(fibonacci(5)) # prints 5
print(fibonacci(8)) # prints 21
```
This code will print the n-th Fibonacci number for any value of `n` that is greater than 1.

Alternatively, you can use a iterative approach to calculate the n-th Fibonacci number using a loop. Here is an example of how to do this:
```
def fibonacci(n):
    a, b = 0, 1
    for i in range(n-1):
        a, b = b, a+b
    return a
```
This code uses a loop to iterate through the Fibonacci sequence, starting from the first two numbers (0 and 1) and then adding each subsequent number to the previous two to get the next number in the sequence. The `range` function is used to create a sequence of numbers from 0 to `n-1`, and the `for` loop iterates through this sequence, incrementing the `a` and `b` variables each time through the loop to calculate the next number in the sequence.

To use this code, simply call the `fibonacci` function with the desired value of `n`:
```
print(fibonacci(5)) # prints 5
print(fibonacci(8)) # prints 21
```
This code will print the n-th Fibonacci number for any value of `n` that is greater than 1.

Note that the iterative approach is generally faster than the recursive approach for large values of `n`, as it avoids the overhead of recursive function calls. However, the recursive approach can be easier to understand and write, especially for smaller values of `n`.</s>  ```
def fibonacci(n):
    a, b = 0, 1
    for i in range(n):
        a, b = b, a + b
    return a
```
This code uses a simple loop to generate the n-th Fibonacci number. It starts with a and b equal to 0 and 1, respectively, which are the first two terms of the Fibonacci sequence. Then, it iterates n times, where each iteration increments a and b by the sum of a and b. The final value of a is the n-th Fibonacci number.</s>  def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
```
This code uses the recursive approach to solve the Fibonacci sequence. The function takes in an integer `n` as input, and it returns the `n`-th Fibonacci number. The function uses a base case of `n <= 1`, where it returns `n` directly. For larger values of `n`, the function recursively calls itself with `n-1` and `n-2` as arguments, and it returns the sum of the two recursive calls.

For example, if we call the function with `n = 5`, it will return `fibonacci(4) + fibonacci(3) = fibonacci(3) + fibonacci(2) = fibonacci(2) + fibonacci(1) = fibonacci(1) + fibonacci(0) = 1 + 0 = 1`.

Note that this code uses the definition of the Fibonacci sequence, where each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers. This definition can be extended to generate the sequence of Fibonacci numbers for larger values of `n`.</s>  ```
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
```
This code uses a recursive approach to calculate the n-th Fibonacci number. It uses the formula for the Fibonacci sequence, which states that each number is the sum of the previous two numbers. The base case is when n is 1 or 2, in which case the answer is simply the number itself. Otherwise, the function calls itself with n-1 and n-2 as arguments, and returns the sum of the two recursive calls.</s>  ```
def fibonacci(n):
    a, b = 0, 1
    for i in range(n):
        a, b = b, a + b
    return a
```
This code uses a simple recursive approach to calculate the n-th Fibonacci number. The function takes a single argument `n`, which represents the number of the Fibonacci number to be calculated.

The function starts by defining two variables `a` and `b` to store the values of the previous and current Fibonacci numbers, respectively. The loop iterates `n` times, where each iteration calculates the next Fibonacci number using the formula `a + b`.

After the loop completes, the function returns the final value of `a`, which is the `n-th` Fibonacci number.

For example, if `n` is set to 5, the function will return 5, since the 5th Fibonacci number is 5.</s>  Here is a Python function that computes the n-th Fibonacci number using the recursive formula:
```
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
```
This function uses the recursive formula for the Fibonacci sequence, which states that each number in the sequence is the sum of the previous two numbers. The base case is when `n` is 1 or 2, in which case the function returns the input value. The recursive case is when `n` is greater than 2, in which case the function calls itself with `n-1` and `n-2` as arguments, and returns the sum of the two recursive calls.

You can test this function with the following code:
```
print(fibonacci(1))  # should print 1
print(fibonacci(2))  # should print 1
print(fibonacci(3))  # should print 2
print(fibonacci(4))  # should print 3
print(fibonacci(5))  # should print 5
```
This code prints the first five Fibonacci numbers using the `fibonacci` function.</s>  ```
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
```</s>
