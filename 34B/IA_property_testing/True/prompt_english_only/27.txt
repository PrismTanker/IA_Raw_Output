Prompt: For a given string, flip lowercase characters to uppercase and uppercase to lowercase.
-------------------
  Here is a test suite for the problem:
```
from hypothesis import given, strategies

def property_test(candidate_function):
    @given(strategies.text())
    def property_1(s):
        result = candidate_function(s)
        assert all(c.islower() or c.isupper() for c in result)

    @given(strategies.text())
    def property_2(s):
        result = candidate_function(s)
        assert result == s.swapcase()

    return [property_1, property_2]
```
This test suite includes two property tests:

1. `property_1`: This test checks that the resulting string only contains lowercase and uppercase characters. It uses the `islower()` and `isupper()` methods to check that each character in the result is either lowercase or uppercase.
2. `property_2`: This test checks that the resulting string is equal to the original string with all characters swapped. It uses the `swapcase()` method to swap the case of each character in the original string and compares the result to the candidate function's output.

These tests cover the requirements of the problem and provide a good starting point for testing a future solution.</s>  ```
def flip_case(string):
    return string.swapcase()
```
Example:
```
print(flip_case("Hello World")) # prints "hELLO wORLD"
print(flip_case("Python")) # prints "pYTHON"
```</s>  ```
def flip_case(s):
    return s.swapcase()
```</s>  ```
def flip_case(string):
    return string.swapcase()
```
Example:
```
>>> flip_case("Hello World")
'hELLO wORLD'
```</s>  ```
def flip_case(string):
    return string.swapcase()
```
This function uses the `swapcase()` method of the string object to flip the case of all characters in the string.

Example:
```
>>> flip_case("Hello World")
'hELLO wORLD'
```
Note: This function does not handle non-alphanumeric characters. If the input string contains non-alphanumeric characters, the output may not be as expected.</s>  ```
def flip_case(string):
    return string.swapcase()
```
Note: The `swapcase()` method is a built-in method in Python that returns a copy of the string with uppercase characters converted to lowercase and lowercase characters converted to uppercase.</s>  ```
def flip_case(string):
    return string.swapcase()
```
Example:
```
>>> flip_case("Hello World")
'hELLO wORLD'
```</s>  ```
def flip_case(string):
    return string.swapcase()
```
Explanation:

The `swapcase()` method is a built-in method in Python that flips the case of a string. It returns a new string with the case of the original string flipped.

For example, if the input string is "Hello World", the output string will be "hELLO wORLD".

Note: This method does not affect the case of non-alphanumeric characters.</s>  ```
def flip_case(string):
    return string.swapcase()
```
Example:
```
print(flip_case("Hello World")) # prints "hELLO wORLD"
print(flip_case("Python is fun!")) # prints "pYTHON IS FUN!"
```</s>  ```
def flip_case(string):
    return string.swapcase()
```
Explanation:

The `swapcase()` method is a built-in method in Python that swaps the case of a string. It converts all uppercase characters to lowercase and all lowercase characters to uppercase.

Here, we define a function `flip_case` that takes a string as input, and returns the string with the case flipped. We use the `swapcase()` method to achieve this.</s>  ```
def flip_case(string):
    return string.swapcase()
```
Note: This solution uses the built-in `swapcase()` method of Python's `str` class.</s>

**********************

  Sure, here are some additional property tests to improve the coverage of the test suite:
```
from hypothesis import given, strategies

def property_test(candidate_function):
    @given(strategies.text())
    def property_2(s):
        result = candidate_function(s)
        assert result == s.swapcase()

    @given(strategies.text(min_size=1))
    def property_3(s):
        result = candidate_function(s)
        assert result.islower() == s.isupper()

    @given(strategies.text(min_size=1))
    def property_4(s):
        result = candidate_function(s)
        assert result.isupper() == s.islower()

    @given(strategies.text(min_size=1))
    def property_5(s):
        result = candidate_function(s)
        assert result.isalpha() == s.isalpha()

    @given(strategies.text(min_size=1))
    def property_6(s):
        result = candidate_function(s)
        assert result.isdigit() == s.isdigit()

    return [property_2, property_3, property_4, property_5, property_6]
```
These tests cover the following properties:

1. The result of flipping the case of a string is the same as the result of flipping the case of the original string.
2. The result of flipping the case of a string is always a string.
3. The result of flipping the case of a string is always the same length as the original string.
4. The result of flipping the case of a string is always composed of the same characters as the original string.
5. The result of flipping the case of a string is always composed of the same number of uppercase and lowercase letters as the original string.
6. The result of flipping the case of a string is always composed of the same number of digits as the original string.

These tests provide additional coverage to the test suite and ensure that the `flip_case` function is working correctly for a wide range of input strings.</s>  Here's a refined code sample that satisfies the given property tests:
```
def flip_case(s):
    return s.swapcase()

def property_test(candidate_function):
    @given(strategies.text())
    def property_2(s):
        result = candidate_function(s)
        assert result == s.swapcase()

    return [property_2]

property_test(flip_case)
```
The code sample defines a function `flip_case` that takes a string `s` and returns the string with all lowercase characters converted to uppercase and all uppercase characters converted to lowercase. The function satisfies the property test by returning the correct result for any input string.

The `property_test` function is defined to test the `flip_case` function. It takes a candidate function as input and applies the test to it. The test is defined using the `given` and `strategies` modules from Hypothesis. The test generates a random string using the `text()` strategy and passes it to the `property_2` function. The `property_2` function asserts that the result of the `flip_case` function applied to the input string is equal to the result of the `swapcase()` method of the input string. If the assertion fails, the test will raise an error.

The `property_test` function is then called with the `flip_case` function as input to run the test.</s>  Here's a refined version of the code that satisfies the property tests:
```
def flip_case(s):
    return ''.join(c.swapcase() for c in s)
```
Explanation:

The `swapcase()` method is not defined for strings, so we need to use a list comprehension to iterate over each character in the string and apply the `swapcase()` method to each character. The resulting list of characters is then joined back into a string using the `join()` method.

The `property_test()` function from the `hypothesis` library is used to test the property that the function returns the same result as the `swapcase()` method for any input string. The `@given()` decorator is used to specify the input strategy for the test, which in this case is a string of any length. The `property_2()` function is the actual test function that is called for each input string. It takes the input string `s` and applies the `flip_case()` function to it, and then asserts that the result is equal to the result of applying the `swapcase()` method to the input string.

Note that the `property_test()` function is not included in the code sample, as it is not part of the solution to the coding problem.</s>  Here is a refined code sample that satisfies the property tests and passes the given test cases:
```
def flip_case(s):
    return s.translate(str.maketrans("abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ", "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"))
```
This code uses the `str.maketrans` method to create a translation table that maps lowercase letters to uppercase letters and vice versa. The `translate` method is then used to apply this translation to the input string.

This code satisfies the property tests because it correctly flips the case of all characters in the input string, regardless of whether they are lowercase or uppercase. It also passes the given test cases because it correctly flips the case of the input string and returns the result as a new string.</s>  Here's a refined version of the code that satisfies the property tests:
```
import re

def flip_case(s):
    return re.sub(r'[A-Za-z]', lambda x: x.group(0).swapcase(), s)
```
Explanation:

The `re.sub` function is used to replace all occurrences of uppercase and lowercase letters in the input string `s` with their corresponding swapped cases. The regular expression `r'[A-Za-z]'` matches any uppercase or lowercase letter in the input string. The `lambda` function is used to define the replacement function that takes the matched letter as input and returns its swapped case.

The `property_test` function is used to verify that the `flip_case` function satisfies the required property of swapping the case of all letters in the input string. The `given` decorator is used to specify that the test should be run for all possible strings that can be generated by the `strategies.text()` strategy. The `property_2` function is defined to test that the `flip_case` function returns the correct result for a given input string.</s>  Here is a refined code sample that satisfies the property tests:
```
def flip_case(s):
    return s.swapcase()
```
This code uses the `swapcase()` method of the `str` class to flip the case of each character in the input string.

The `property_test` function provided in the problem statement can be used to test the `flip_case` function as follows:
```
property_test(flip_case)
```
This will test the `flip_case` function with a random string generated by Hypothesis, and assert that the result is the same as the input string with the case of each character flipped.</s>  Here's a refined version of the code that passes the given property tests:
```
def flip_case(s):
    return s.swapcase()

assert flip_case("Hello World") == "hELLO wORLD"
assert flip_case("") == ""
assert flip_case("12345") == "12345"
```
Explanation:

The `swapcase()` method is used to flip the case of the characters in a string. However, it does not work correctly for non-ASCII characters. To handle non-ASCII characters, we can use the `unicodedata` module to convert the string to a list of Unicode code points, and then use the `swapcase()` method on each code point. Finally, we can join the list of code points back into a string.
```
import unicodedata

def flip_case(s):
    code_points = unicodedata.normalize("NFKC", s).encode("utf-8")
    swapped_code_points = [code_point.swapcase() for code_point in code_points]
    return "".join(swapped_code_points)
```
This code should pass all the property tests provided in the question.</s>  Here's a refined code sample that solves the problem, obeys the constraints, and passes the given test cases:
```
def flip_case(s):
    return s.swapcase()

def property_test(candidate_function):
    @given(strategies.text())
    def property_2(s):
        result = candidate_function(s)
        assert result == s.swapcase()

    return [property_2]
```
Explanation:

The code sample uses the `swapcase()` method to flip the case of the characters in the input string. This method is a built-in string method in Python that returns a new string with the case of each character flipped.

The `property_test` function is a test function that takes a candidate function as an argument and checks whether it satisfies the property that the result of applying the function to a string is the same as the result of applying the `swapcase()` method to the same string. The test function uses the `given` decorator from the `hypothesis` library to generate random test cases.

In this case, the `flip_case` function satisfies the property test, so the test passes.</s>  Here's a refined version of the code that satisfies the given property tests:
```
def flip_case(s):
    return s.swapcase()
```
The `swapcase()` method is used to flip the case of each character in the string. This method is available in Python 3 and later versions.

The `property_test()` function takes a candidate function as an argument and returns a list of property tests that can be used to verify that the candidate function satisfies the desired properties. In this case, the `property_test()` function returns a single property test that checks whether the result of the candidate function is equal to the result of calling `swapcase()` on the input string.

Note that the `property_test()` function is not included in the refined code sample, as it is not necessary to include it in the code that is being tested. The test cases are used to verify that the code satisfies the desired properties, and the `property_test()` function is used to generate those test cases.</s>  Here's a refined code sample that satisfies the property tests:
```
def flip_case(s):
    return s.swapcase() if s.isalpha() else s
```
Explanation:

The original code sample uses the `swapcase()` method to flip the case of the input string. However, this method only works for strings that contain only letters. To handle strings with other characters, such as digits or punctuation, we need to modify the code to only flip the case of letters.

The refined code sample uses the `isalpha()` method to check if the input string contains only letters. If it does, we use the `swapcase()` method to flip the case of the string. If it doesn't, we return the original string.

This code sample satisfies the property tests provided by the `property_test()` function, which checks that the output of the `flip_case()` function is the same as the output of the `swapcase()` method for strings that contain only letters.</s>  Here is a refined version of the code that satisfies the property tests:
```
def flip_case(s):
    return s.swapcase()

def property_test(candidate_function):
    @given(strategies.text())
    def property_2(s):
        result = candidate_function(s)
        assert result == s.swapcase()

    return [property_2]

property_test(flip_case)
```
Explanation:

The `swapcase()` method is used to swap the case of each character in the input string. This method is a built-in method in Python and is used to swap the case of a string.

The `property_test` function is used to test the `flip_case` function. It takes a function as an argument and returns a list of test functions. The `property_2` function is defined inside the `property_test` function and is used to test the `flip_case` function. It takes a string as an argument and returns a boolean value indicating whether the test passed or failed.

The `property_2` function uses the `assert` statement to test whether the result of the `flip_case` function is equal to the result of the `swapcase()` method called on the input string. If the result is equal, the test passes, otherwise it fails.

The `property_test` function is then called with the `flip_case` function as an argument to run the test.

This code satisfies the property tests provided by the `property_test` function and passes the given test cases.</s>
