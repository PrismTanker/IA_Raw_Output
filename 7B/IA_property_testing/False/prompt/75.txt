-------------------
  Here is a test suite for the `is_multiply_prime` function:
```
from hypothesis import given, strategies

def property_test(candidate_function):

    @given(strategies.integers(0, 100))
    def property_1(a):
        assert candidate_function(a) == (a % 3 == 0) and (a % 5 == 0) and (a % 7 == 0)

    @given(strategies.integers(0, 100))
    def property_2(a):
        assert not candidate_function(a) or (a % 3 != 0) or (a % 5 != 0) or (a % 7 != 0)

    return [property_1, property_2]
```
The `property_test` function takes a candidate function as an argument and returns a list of two property tests: `property_1` and `property_2`.

The `property_1` test checks that the candidate function returns `True` when the input number is the multiplication of three prime numbers, and `False` otherwise. The test checks that the input number is divisible by 3, 5, and 7, and that the function returns `True` when these conditions are met.

The `property_2` test checks that the candidate function returns `False` when the input number is not the multiplication of three prime numbers, and `True` otherwise. The test checks that the input number is not divisible by 3, 5, or 7, and that the function returns `False` when these conditions are met.

To use the test suite, you can simply call the `property_test` function and pass in the `is_multiply_prime` function as an argument. The function will return a list of property tests that can be run on the `is_multiply_prime` function.

For example:
```
tests = property_test(is_multiply_prime)
for test in tests:
    test()
```
This will run all of the property tests on the `is_multiply_prime` function and print the results.</s>  ```
def is_multiply_prime(a):
    if a < 100:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(a ** 0.5) + 1):
        if a % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```
This function uses the fact that if a number is the multiplication of 3 prime numbers, it must be divisible by at least one of those prime numbers. Therefore, we can check if the number is divisible by any of the prime numbers less than or equal to its square root. If it is not divisible by any prime number less than or equal to its square root, then it must be the multiplication of 3 prime numbers.

We can use the `range` function to generate a list of prime numbers less than or equal to the square root of `a`. We can then use the `any` function to check if any of the prime numbers in the list are divisors of `a`. If there is a divisor, we return `False`. If there is no divisor, we return `True`.

The `int(a ** 0.5) + 1` expression is used to calculate the square root of `a` and add 1 to it. This is because we want to include the square root in the list of prime numbers to check.

Note that this function only works for positive integers. If you need to handle negative integers or floating-point numbers, you will need to modify the function accordingly.</s>  Here is a possible solution to the problem:
```
def is_multiply_prime(a):
    if a < 100:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(a ** 0.5) + 1):
        if a % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```
This solution uses a simple loop to check if the given number is the multiplication of 3 prime numbers. It first checks if the number is less than 100, since the problem states that the number is less than 100. If the number is less than 100, it immediately returns False.

If the number is greater than 100, the function uses a loop to check if it can be divided by any number less than its square root (since if it can be divided by a number less than its square root, it must be the product of 3 prime numbers). If the number can be divided by a number less than its square root, it returns False.

Finally, if the number cannot be divided by any number less than its square root, it returns True, since it must be the product of 3 prime numbers.

Note that this solution assumes that the input number is a positive integer. If the input number can be a negative integer, you may need to modify the solution to handle that case.</s>  ```
def is_multiply_prime(a):
    if a < 100:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(a ** 0.5) + 1):
        if a % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```
Explanation:

The function first checks if the given number (a) is less than 100, since the problem states that the number is less than 100. If it is, it returns False immediately.

Next, the function uses a loop to iterate from 2 to the square root of the given number (a) (int(a ** 0.5) + 1). Inside the loop, it checks if the current number (i) divides the given number (a). If it does, it returns False.

If the loop completes without returning False, it means that the given number (a) is the multiplication of 3 prime numbers, so the function returns True.

Note that this solution assumes that the given number is a positive integer. If the number can be negative or non-integer, you may need to modify the function accordingly.</s>  Here is the code to solve the problem:
```
def is_multiply_prime(a):
    if a < 100:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(a ** 0.5) + 1):
        if a % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```
Explanation:

The function first checks if the given number `a` is less than 100. If it is, it returns `False` immediately, as the number cannot be the multiplication of 3 prime numbers.

Otherwise, the function iterates from 2 to the square root of `a` (inclusive) and checks if `a` is divisible by any number in the range. If it is, the function returns `False`.

If the function reaches the end of the loop without returning `False`, it means that `a` is the multiplication of 3 prime numbers, so it returns `True`.</s>
