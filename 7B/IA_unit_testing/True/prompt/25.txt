-------------------
  Here is a test suite for the `factorize` function:
```
{
    "test_prime_factors_of_8": {
        "in": {
            "n": 8
        },
        "out": [2, 2, 2]
    },
    "test_prime_factors_of_25": {
        "in": {
            "n": 25
        },
        "out": [5, 5]
    },
    "test_prime_factors_of_70": {
        "in": {
            "n": 70
        },
        "out": [2, 5, 7]
    },
    "test_input_invalid_type": {
        "in": {
            "n": "a"
        },
        "out": "TypeError"
    },
    "test_input_invalid_value": {
        "in": {
            "n": -1
        },
        "out": "ValueError"
    }
}
```
In this test suite, we have four tests:

1. `test_prime_factors_of_8`: Tests the `factorize` function with input `n=8` and expects output `[2, 2, 2]`.
2. `test_prime_factors_of_25`: Tests the `factorize` function with input `n=25` and expects output `[5, 5]`.
3. `test_prime_factors_of_70`: Tests the `factorize` function with input `n=70` and expects output `[2, 5, 7]`.
4. `test_input_invalid_type`: Tests the `factorize` function with input `n="a"` and expects output `"TypeError"`.
5. `test_input_invalid_value`: Tests the `factorize` function with input `n=-1` and expects output `"ValueError"`.

Note that we have also included a test for invalid input types and values to ensure that the `factorize` function raises the appropriate exceptions when the input is not of the correct type or value.</s>  Here's the code:
```
def factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:
    factors = []
    i = 2
    while i * i <= n:
        while n % i == 0:
            factors.append(i)
            n //= i
        i += 1
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)
    return factors
```
This code uses a simple algorithm to factorize a number. It starts with the smallest prime numbers (2, 3, 5, ...) and checks if they divide the input number. If it does, it adds the prime number to a list and divides the number by the prime number. It continues this process until the number is reduced to 1, which indicates that all prime factors have been found. The list of prime factors is returned.

Note that this code assumes that the input number is a positive integer. If the input number is negative, the code will produce incorrect results. Also, this code does not check for the special case where the input number is 1, which is a special number that is the product of no prime factors.</s>  ```

[/CODE]  This code uses the Euclidean algorithm to factorize the given integer. It starts with the number and iteratively divides it by 2 until it reaches 1. Each time it divides, it adds the divisor to the list of factors. If the number is not divisible by any other factors, it returns the list of factors in the order from smallest to largest.</s>  Here is a sample Python code that satisfies the requirements:
```
from typing import List

def factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:
    factors = []
    i = 2
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i:
            i += 1
        else:
            n //= i
            factors.append(i)
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)
    return factors
```
This code uses a simple while loop to iterate through the factors of `n`, starting from 2 and increasing by 1 until the square root of `n`. It checks if each factor is a divisor of `n` and if so, it updates the factorization by dividing `n` by that factor and appending it to the list of factors. Finally, if `n` is not a perfect square, it is added to the list of factors.

Note that this code uses the `//` operator for integer division, which always returns a float. If you want to return an integer, you can use the `//` operator and cast the result to an integer:
```
def factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:
    factors = []
    i = 2
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i:
            i += 1
        else:
            n //= i
            factors.append(int(i))
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(int(n))
    return factors
```</s>
