Prompt: Check if a given number can be divided by 3 prime numbers.
-------------------
  Here is a JSON sample that represents a test suite to check if a given number can be divided by 3 prime numbers:

{
"test1": {
"in": {
"n": 6
},
"out": true
},
"test2": {
"in": {
"n": 9
},
"out": false
},
"test3": {
"in": {
"n": 12
},
"out": true
},
"test4": {
"in": {
"n": 15
},
"out": false
},
"test5": {
"in": {
"n": 18
},
"out": true
}
}

This test suite includes 5 tests:

* test1: n = 6, which is divisible by 2 and 3
* test2: n = 9, which is not divisible by 3 prime numbers
* test3: n = 12, which is divisible by 2, 3 and 4
* test4: n = 15, which is not divisible by 3 prime numbers
* test5: n = 18, which is divisible by 2, 3 and 6</s>  Here is a sample JSON test suite to test a hypothetical solution for the problem of checking if a given number can be divided by 3 prime numbers:
```
{
  "test_divisible_by_3_prime_numbers": {
    "in": {
      "n": 90
    },
    "out": true
  },
  "test_not_divisible_by_3_prime_numbers": {
    "in": {
      "n": 10
    },
    "out": false
  },
  "test_divisible_by_3_prime_numbers_with_prime_factors": {
    "in": {
      "n": 120
    },
    "out": true
  },
  "test_not_divisible_by_3_prime_numbers_with_prime_factors": {
    "in": {
      "n": 15
    },
    "out": false
  }
}
```
In this test suite, we have four tests:

* `test_divisible_by_3_prime_numbers`: This test checks if the number 90 can be divided by 3 prime numbers. The expected output is `true`.
* `test_not_divisible_by_3_prime_numbers`: This test checks if the number 10 can be divided by 3 prime numbers. The expected output is `false`.
* `test_divisible_by_3_prime_numbers_with_prime_factors`: This test checks if the number 120 can be divided by 3 prime numbers, but with the additional constraint that the prime factors must be factors of the number 120. The expected output is `true`.
* `test_not_divisible_by_3_prime_numbers_with_prime_factors`: This test checks if the number 15 can be divided by 3 prime numbers, but with the additional constraint that the prime factors must be factors of the number 15. The expected output is `false`.

Note that the inputs and expected outputs are represented in JSON format, with the `in` key representing the input parameters and the `out` key representing the expected output.</s>
