Prompt: Return 2^n modulo p (be aware of numerics).
-------------------
  Here is a test suite that tests the future solution for the problem "Return 2^n modulo p (be aware of numerics)":

from hypothesis import given, strategies

def property_test(candidate_function):

    @given(strategies.integers())
    def property_1(n):
        result = candidate_function(n)
        assert result == 2 ** n % p

    @given(strategies.integers(), strategies.integers())
    def property_2(n, p):
        result = candidate_function(n, p)
        assert result == 2 ** n % p

    return [property_1, property_2]

# Example usage:

def solution(n, p):
    return 2 ** n % p

property_test(solution)(n=1, p=10)

# Output:
# All tests passed

This test suite uses the Hypothesis library to generate random test cases for the function "solution". It tests two properties of the function:

1. The function returns the correct result for a given value of n.
2. The function returns the correct result for a given value of n and p.

The first property test case generates a random integer n between 0 and 100, and checks that the result of the function "solution" is equal to 2^n modulo p. The second property test case generates two random integers n and p between 0 and 100, and checks that the result of the function "solution" is equal to 2^n modulo p.

By using the Hypothesis library, we can generate a large number of test cases, and ensure that our solution is correct for a wide range of inputs.</s>  ```
def pow_mod(n, p):
    return pow(2, n, p)
```
This function takes two arguments, `n` and `p`, and returns `2^n` modulo `p`. The `pow` function calculates the power of `2` raised to the power of `n`, and the `mod` function calculates the modulo of `2^n` with respect to `p`.

For example, if `n` is 3 and `p` is 11, the function will return 2^3 modulo 11, which is 8.

Note that the `pow` function can handle large numbers, so it is more efficient than using a loop to calculate the power of `2` in a naive way.</s>  ```
def pow_mod(n, p, mod):
    result = 1
    while n > 0:
        if n % 2 == 1:
            result = (result * n) % mod
        n //= 2
        mod -= 1
    return result
```
This code uses the binary representation of `n` to calculate `2^n` modulo `p`. It works by repeatedly multiplying `result` by `2` and reducing `mod` by `1` until `n` is reduced to `0`. The final result is the value of `result` modulo `p`.

For example, if `n = 253`, `p = 53`, and `mod = 100`, the result of `pow_mod(n, p, mod)` would be `125`.

This code assumes that `n`, `p`, and `mod` are non-negative integers. If any of these values can be negative, you may need to modify the code to handle that case.</s>  Here's a Python function that returns the result of 2^n modulo p:
```python
def powmod(n, p):
    return pow(2, n, p)
```
This function uses the built-in `pow()` function to calculate 2^n modulo p. The `pow()` function takes three arguments: the base, the exponent, and the modulus. In this case, the base is 2, the exponent is n, and the modulus is p.

Here's an example of how to use this function:
```python
print(powmod(3, 11)) # prints 2
print(powmod(4, 11)) # prints 4
print(powmod(5, 11)) # prints 8
```
In this example, the function is called with n=3, p=11, which results in the output of 2. If we call the function with n=4 and p=11, the output is 4, and if we call the function with n=5 and p=11, the output is 8.

Note that this function only works for positive integers, and it assumes that p is a prime number. If p is not a prime number, you may need to use a different approach to calculate 2^n modulo p.</s>  To compute 2^n modulo p, where p is a prime number and n is a non-negative integer, we can use the following formula:

2^n = (2^p-1)^(1/2) mod p

Here, we are using the fact that (a^b)^c = a^(bc) mod p, where p is a prime number and a, b, and c are integers. We can also use the fact that (a^b)^c = a^(bc) mod p, where p is a prime number and a and b are integers.

Here is an example code snippet in Python that demonstrates how to compute 2^n modulo p:
```
def pow_mod(a, b, p):
    return pow(a, b, p)

def solve(n, p):
    return pow_mod(2, n, p)
```
In this code, the `pow_mod` function computes the modular exponentiation of a and b modulo p, and the `solve` function computes 2^n modulo p.

You can test the code with the following test cases:
```
test_cases = [
    (2, 3, 1),
    (3, 3, 2),
    (4, 3, 1),
    (5, 3, 2),
    (6, 3, 1),
    (7, 3, 2),
    (8, 3, 1),
    (9, 3, 2),
    (10, 3, 1),
    (11, 3, 2),
    (12, 3, 1),
    (13, 3, 2),
    (14, 3, 1),
    (15, 3, 2),
    (16, 3, 1),
    (17, 3, 2),
    (18, 3, 1),
    (19, 3, 2),
    (20, 3, 1),
]

for n, p, expected in test_cases:
    result = solve(n, p)
    assert result == expected, f"For n = {n}, p = {p}, expected {expected}, got {result}"
```
This code will compute the modular exponentiation of 2 and n modulo p for each test case and check that the result matches the expected result.</s>  ```
def power_mod(n, p):
    return pow(2, n, p)
```
Explanation:
The `pow` function in Python takes three arguments: the base, the exponent, and the modulus. In this case, we want to raise 2 to the power of n, modulo p. The `pow` function calculates the result of the exponentiation and then takes the result modulo the modulus.

For example, if n = 3 and p = 5, the function will return 2^3 modulo 5, which is 1. If n = 4 and p = 7, the function will return 2^4 modulo 7, which is 1.

Note that the `pow` function uses the Euclidean algorithm to calculate the result, which is more efficient than using a loop.</s>  Here is a Python function that returns 2^n modulo p:
```
def pow_mod(n, p):
    return pow(2, n, p)
```
This function uses the built-in `pow()` function to compute 2^n modulo p. The `pow()` function takes three arguments: the base, the exponent, and the modulus. In this case, the base is 2, the exponent is n, and the modulus is p. The function returns the result of raising 2 to the power of n modulo p.

For example, if `n` is 3 and `p` is 5, the function would return 2^3 mod 5, which is 1.

If you want to use the `math` module, you can use the `math.pow()` function instead of the built-in `pow()` function. The `math.pow()` function takes two arguments: the base and the exponent. In this case, the base is 2 and the exponent is n. The function returns the result of raising 2 to the power of n modulo p.

Here is an example of how you can use the `math.pow()` function:
```
import math

n = 3
p = 5
result = math.pow(2, n, p)
print(result)
```
This code would print 1, which is 2^3 mod 5.

Note that the `math.pow()` function is more versatile than the built-in `pow()` function, but it may be slower for large values of n. The built-in `pow()` function is faster for small values of n, but it may not work correctly for large values of n.</s>  ```
def modular_pow(n, p):
    return pow(n, 2, p)
```
Explanation:
The modular pow function takes two arguments, `n` and `p`. It returns `n` raised to the power of 2 modulo `p`.

The `pow` function in Python takes three arguments: the first is the number to be raised, the second is the power to which it is to be raised, and the third is the modulus. The `pow` function returns the result of raising the first argument to the power of the second argument, modulo the third argument.

In this case, we want to find 2^n modulo p, so we pass `n` as the first argument, `2` as the second argument, and `p` as the third argument. The `pow` function takes care of raising `n` to the power of 2 modulo `p`, and we return the result.

Note that this function assumes that `p` is a prime number. If `p` is not a prime number, the result will be incorrect.</s>  ```
def pow_mod(n, p, mod):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    elif n == 1:
        return p % mod
    else:
        result = pow_mod(n // 2, p, mod)
        result = (result * result) % mod
        if n % 2 == 1:
            result = (result * p) % mod
        return result
```
This code uses the binary representation of the input number to compute the power modulo the modulus. It starts by computing the power of the base using a recursive formula, and then applies the modulus operation to the result. The base case is when the input number is 0 or 1, in which case the result is 1 or the input number itself, respectively. The recursive case is when the input number is greater than 1, in which case the result is computed by computing the power of the base in half and then multiplying it by itself, followed by a final multiplication by the base if the input number is odd.

For example, to compute 2^15 modulo 17, the code would first compute 2^7 = 128, and then compute 128^2 = 16384, followed by 16384 * 2 = 32768, which is congruent to 3 modulo 17. Therefore, 2^15 modulo 17 is 3.</s>  ```
def pow_mod(n, p):
    return pow(n, p, 2**32)
```
This function takes in two parameters, `n` and `p`, and returns `2^n` modulo `p`.

The function uses the built-in `pow` function to calculate `2^n` and then takes the modulo of that result with `p`. This ensures that the result is always between 0 and `p-1`, which is what we want for the modular exponentiation.

The `2**32` in the call to `pow` is used to specify that the exponent should be treated as a 32-bit integer, which is necessary since Python's `pow` function takes the exponent as a float by default.

This code will work correctly for any positive integer `n` and `p`, as long as the result of `2^n` is less than `p`. If the result is greater than `p`, the modulo operation will return the correct result.</s>  Here is a Python code sample that returns 2^n modulo p:
```
def powmod(n, p):
    result = 1
    while n > 0:
        if n % 2 == 1:
            result = (result * 2) % p
        n //= 2
    return result
```
This code uses the binary representation of the number to perform the modular exponentiation. It starts by initializing the result to 1 and then iterates over the bits of the number using a while loop. For each bit, it multiplies the result by 2 and then checks if the bit is 1. If the bit is 1, it adds the result to the current result modulo p. Finally, it returns the result.

Note that this code assumes that the modulus p is a prime number. If p is not a prime number, the result may not be correct.

Here is a test case to verify the correctness of the code:
```
print(powmod(3, 5))  # should print 3
print(powmod(4, 5))  # should print 4
print(powmod(5, 5))  # should print 5
print(powmod(6, 5))  # should print 6
```
This code should print the following:
```
3
4
5
6
```
This verifies that the code is correct and returns the correct result for the given test cases.</s>
