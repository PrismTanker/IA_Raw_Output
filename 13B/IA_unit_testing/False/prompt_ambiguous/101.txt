import re

def split_words(string):
    words = re.split(r'\s+', string)
    return words
```
This code uses the `re` module to split the string into words based on one or more whitespace characters. The `re.split()` function takes a regular expression as its first argument, which in this case is `r'\s+'`, which matches one or more whitespace characters. The `r` prefix is used to indicate that the string should be treated as a raw string, which avoids the need to escape any special characters. The resulting array of words is returned.

Here is an example usage of the function:
```
string = "Hello, World!"
words = split_words(string)
print(words)  # Output: ['Hello', 'World!']
```
This function can be used to split any string of words into an array of individual words, and can be easily modified to handle different types of whitespace characters or other delimiters.</s>  ```
def get_words(string):
    return string.split()
```

This code uses the `split()` method of the `str` class to split the string into an array of words. The `split()` method returns an array of substrings, where each substring is a word in the original string.

Here is an example of how the function can be used:
```
print(get_words("hello world"))
# Output: ['hello', 'world']
```</s>  ```
def split_words(my_string):
    return my_string.split()
```

This function uses the `split()` method of the `str` class to split the input string into words and return an array of the words. The `split()` method takes no arguments and splits the string on whitespace characters, including spaces, tabs, and newlines.

Here is an example of how the function can be used:
```
>>> my_string = "Hello, World!"
>>> split_words(my_string)
['Hello', 'World!']
```
This function will work for any string that contains words separated by whitespace characters.

Note: This function assumes that the input string is a valid string and does not contain any special characters or other non-word characters. If the input string contains special characters or other non-word characters, the function may not work as expected.

Also, note that this function does not remove any duplicates from the list of words. If the input string contains duplicate words, the function will return a list of all the duplicate words.

For example:
```
>>> my_string = "Hello, World! Hello"
>>> split_words(my_string)
['Hello', 'World!', 'Hello']
```
If you want to remove duplicates from the list of words, you can use the `set()` function to convert the list to a set and then convert the set back to a list.
```
def split_words(my_string):
    words = my_string.split()
    return list(set(words))
```
This function will return a list of unique words from the input string, without any duplicates.

For example:
```
>>> my_string = "Hello, World! Hello"
>>> split_words(my_string)
['Hello', 'World!']
```</s>  ```
import re

def split_words(string):
    return re.split(r"\s+", string)
```

This function uses the `re` module to split the string on one or more whitespace characters (`\s+`). The `r` prefix tells Python to treat the string as a raw string, which allows us to use the `\s` metacharacter to match any whitespace character. The `+` quantifier specifies that the pattern should match one or more whitespace characters.

Here's an example of how you can use this function:
```
>>> split_words("Hello, World!")
['Hello', 'World!']
```
This function will split the string into an array of words, with each word separated by one or more whitespace characters.

Note that this function assumes that the input string is a simple space-delimited string. If you need to handle more complex cases, such as strings with multiple whitespace characters or strings with non-whitespace separators, you may need to modify the regular expression pattern used in the `re.split()` function.</s>  ```
def get_words(string):
    return string.split()
```
This code uses the `split()` method of the string object to split the input string into words and return an array of the words.

Here is an example usage of the function:
```
print(get_words("Hello World"))
# Output: ['Hello', 'World']
```</s>  ```
def get_words(string):
    return string.split()
```
This code splits the input string into words using the `split()` method of the string object. The `split()` method returns a list of words. The `get_words()` function takes the input string as an argument and returns the list of words.

Here is an example usage of the function:
```
string = "hello world"
words = get_words(string)
print(words)  # Output: ['hello', 'world']
```
This code splits the input string into words and prints the resulting list of words.

Note that this function assumes that the input string contains only words separated by spaces. If the input string contains any other characters, such as punctuation or special characters, they will be treated as part of the words.

Also, note that this function does not handle any special cases such as empty strings or strings with only spaces. It is up to the user to handle those cases if needed.</s>  ```
def split_words(string):
    return string.split()
```
This function uses the `split()` method of the `str` class to split the input string into words and return an array of the words.

Here is an example of how to use this function:
```
print(split_words("This is a string of words"))
```
This will output the following: `['This', 'is', 'a', 'string', 'of', 'words']`</s>  ```
def split_words(string):
    return string.split()
```
This code uses the `split()` method of the `str` class to split the input string into words, and returns an array of the words.

Here's an example usage:
```
print(split_words("Hello, World!"))  # Output: ['Hello', ',', 'World!']
```
Note that the `split()` method by default splits the string into words using whitespace as the delimiter, so it will also split on commas, periods, and other punctuation marks. If you only want to split on whitespace, you can use the `split()` method with the `maxsplit` argument set to 1:
```
def split_words(string):
    return string.split(maxsplit=1)
```
This will split the string into words at the first whitespace character.

Also, you can use the `re` module for more advanced splitting:
```
import re

def split_words(string):
    return re.split(r"\W+", string)
```
This will split the string into words using any non-word character as the delimiter.</s>  ```
def get_words(my_string):
    return my_string.split()
```
Here is an example of how to use this function:
```
my_string = "Hello, World!"
words = get_words(my_string)
print(words)  # Output: ['Hello', 'World!']
```
This function uses the `split()` method of the `str` class in Python to split the string into words and returns an array of the words.

Note: This function assumes that the string contains only words separated by spaces. If the string contains any other characters, such as punctuation marks or numbers, they will be included in the output.

Also, if you want to split the string based on a specific character, you can use the `split()` method with the character as an argument, like this:
```
my_string = "Hello,World!"
words = my_string.split(",")
print(words)  # Output: ['Hello', 'World!']
```
This will split the string based on the comma character and return an array of the words.</s>  ```
import re

def split_words(string):
    return re.split(r'\s+', string)
```
This function uses the `re.split` function with the regular expression `\s+` to split the string into words. The regular expression matches one or more whitespace characters, which is used to split the string into an array of words.

Here is an example usage of the function:
```
string = "Hello, World!"
words = split_words(string)
print(words)  # Output: ["Hello", "World!"]
```</s>
