Prompt:  Return list of prime factors of given integer in the order from smallest to largest.
    Each of the factors should be listed number of times corresponding to how many times it appeares in factorization.
    Input number should be equal to the product of all factors
    >>> factorize(8)
    [2, 2, 2]
    >>> factorize(25)
    [5, 5]
    >>> factorize(70)
    [2, 5, 7]

  Here is a JSON sample that represents a test suite for the problem of finding the prime factors of a given integer:

{
  "test1": {
    "in": {
      "n": 8
    },
    "out": [2, 2, 2]
  },
  "test2": {
    "in": {
      "n": 25
    },
    "out": [5, 5]
  },
  "test3": {
    "in": {
      "n": 70
    },
    "out": [2, 5, 7]
  }
}

In this test suite, the inputs to the function are represented as a JSON object with a single key-value pair, "n", which represents the integer to be factored. The expected output of the function is represented as a JSON array, where each element in the array represents a prime factor of the input integer. The number of elements in the output array corresponds to the number of prime factors of the input integer, and each element is the prime factor itself.

In the example above, the input integer is 8, which has 3 prime factors (2, 2, and 2). The expected output of the function is [2, 2, 2], which is the list of prime factors of 8 in the order from smallest to largest. The same applies to the other two test cases.</s>  {
"test_case_1": {
"in": {
"n": 8
},
"out": [2, 2, 2]
},
"test_case_2": {
"in": {
"n": 25
},
"out": [5, 5]
},
"test_case_3": {
"in": {
"n": 70
},
"out": [2, 5, 7]
},
"test_case_4": {
"in": {
"n": 100
},
"out": [2, 2, 5, 5]
}
}

In the above JSON sample, we have four test cases. Each test case consists of an input (n) and an expected output. The input is passed as a parameter to the function, and the expected output is the output that is expected to be returned by the function. In the test cases, we are testing the factorization of the input number n by verifying that the output matches the expected output.

The first test case (test_case_1) tests the factorization of the input number 8. The input is 8, and the expected output is [2, 2, 2]. The second test case (test_case_2) tests the factorization of the input number 25. The input is 25, and the expected output is [5, 5]. The third test case (test_case_3) tests the factorization of the input number 70. The input is 70, and the expected output is [2, 5, 7]. The fourth test case (test_case_4) tests the factorization of the input number 100. The input is 100, and the expected output is [2, 2, 5, 5].

Note that the JSON sample uses all lower case for true and false.</s>  Here is a JSON sample that represents a test suite for the function `factorize`:

This test suite includes a series of tests for different input values, each with a corresponding expected output. The tests cover a range of values, from small integers like 8 and 25 to larger integers like 300 and 5000. The expected output for each test is a list of prime factors of the input value, sorted in order from smallest to largest, with each factor listed the number of times it appears in the factorization.

Note that the JSON file uses all lowercase for `true` and `false`, and that the values for the input parameter `n` are enclosed in double quotes. This is necessary because JSON uses double quotes to enclose string values, and the `n` parameter is a string.</s>  ```
def factorize(n):
    factors = []
    i = 2
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i:
            i += 1
        else:
            n //= i
            factors.append(i)
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)
    return factors

        else:
            n //= i
            factors.append(i)

This code uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to find the prime factors of a given number. It starts by initializing an empty list `factors` and a variable `i` to 2. It then loops until `i * i > n`, where `n` is the input number.

In each iteration, the code checks if `n` is divisible by `i`. If it is, then `n` is divided by `i` and the result is stored in `n`. If `n` is not divisible by `i`, then `i` is incremented and the process is repeated.

Once the loop is finished, the code checks if `n` is greater than 1. If it is, then `n` is added to the `factors` list. Finally, the `factors` list is returned.

The code is efficient because it uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm, which is an efficient method for finding the prime factors of a number. It also uses a simple and intuitive approach to the problem, which makes it easy to understand and implement.</s>
