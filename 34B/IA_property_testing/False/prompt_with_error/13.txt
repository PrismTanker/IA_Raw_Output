Prompt: Return a lowest common multiple of two integers a and b
-------------------
  Here's a test suite for the hypothetical future solution to the problem of returning the lowest common multiple of two integers `a` and `b`:
```
from hypothesis import given, strategies

def lcm(a, b):
    # This is the hypothetical future solution
    pass

def property_test(candidate_function):
    @given(strategies.integers(), strategies.integers())
    def property_1(a, b):
        result = candidate_function(a, b)
        assert result >= a and result >= b

    @given(strategies.integers(), strategies.integers())
    def property_2(a, b):
        result = candidate_function(a, b)
        assert result % a == 0 and result % b == 0

    return [property_1, property_2]

tests = property_test(lcm)
```
This test suite uses the `hypothesis` library to generate random inputs for the `lcm` function and checks that the output is a positive integer that is divisible by both `a` and `b`. The `property_test` function takes the `lcm` function as an argument and returns a list of two property tests that can be run using the `hypothesis` library.

You can run this test suite using the following command:
```
$ python -m hypothesis.main tests
```
This will run the two property tests in the `tests` list and report any failures or errors.</s>  ```
def lowest_common_multiple(a, b):
    if a > b:
        a, b = b, a
    for i in range(a, b * a + 1, a):
        if i % b == 0:
            return i
```
This function takes two integers `a` and `b` as input and returns their lowest common multiple (LCM). The function first checks if `a` is greater than `b`, and if so, it swaps the values of `a` and `b`. Then, it starts iterating from `a` to `b * a` in steps of `a` and checks if each number is divisible by `b`. If a number is divisible by `b`, it returns that number as the LCM. If no number is divisible by `b`, the function returns the last number in the range, which is `b * a`.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```
print(lowest_common_multiple(12, 15)) # Output: 60
```
In this example, the function returns the LCM of 12 and 15, which is 60.</s>  ```
def lowest_common_multiple(a, b):
    if a > b:
        a, b = b, a
    for i in range(a, b * 2, a):
        if i % b == 0:
            return i
```</s>  ```
def lcm(a, b):
    if a > b:
        greater = a
    else:
        greater = b
    while True:
        if (greater % a == 0) and (greater % b == 0):
            lcm = greater
            break
        greater += 1
    return lcm
```</s>  ```
def lcm(a, b):
    if a > b:
        greater = a
    else:
        greater = b
    while True:
        if (greater % a == 0) and (greater % b == 0):
            lcm = greater
            break
        greater += 1
    return lcm
```</s>  ```
def lcm(a, b):
    if a > b:
        greater = a
    else:
        greater = b
    while True:
        if (greater % a == 0) and (greater % b == 0):
            lcm = greater
            break
        greater += 1
    return lcm
```
This code uses the fact that the least common multiple of two integers `a` and `b` is the smallest number that both `a` and `b` divide into. It first finds the larger of the two numbers and then iterates up from that number until it finds a number that both `a` and `b` divide into. This number is the least common multiple.

Here is an example of how to use this function:
```
a = 6
b = 8
print(lcm(a, b)) # Output: 24
```
This code will output 24, which is the least common multiple of 6 and 8.</s>  ```
def lowest_common_multiple(a, b):
    if a > b:
        a, b = b, a
    for i in range(a, b * 2, a):
        if i % b == 0:
            return i
```</s>  ```
def lcm(a, b):
    if a > b:
        greater = a
    else:
        greater = b
    while True:
        if (greater % a == 0) and (greater % b == 0):
            lcm = greater
            break
        greater += 1
    return lcm
```
This code defines a function called `lcm` that takes two integers `a` and `b` as input. It first checks if `a` is greater than `b`, and if so, sets `greater` to `a`. Otherwise, it sets `greater` to `b`.

Then, it starts a loop that increments `greater` by 1 in each iteration, and checks if `greater` is divisible by both `a` and `b`. If it is, it sets `lcm` to `greater` and breaks out of the loop. If it's not, it continues the loop.

The function returns the lowest common multiple of `a` and `b`.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```
print(lcm(12, 15)) # Output: 60
```
This prints `60`, which is the lowest common multiple of `12` and `15`.</s>  ```
def lcm(a, b):
    if a > b:
        greater = a
    else:
        greater = b
    while True:
        if (greater % a == 0) and (greater % b == 0):
            lcm = greater
            break
        greater += 1
    return lcm
```</s>  ```
def lcm(a, b):
    if a > b:
        greater = a
    else:
        greater = b
    while True:
        if (greater % a == 0) and (greater % b == 0):
            lcm = greater
            break
        greater += 1
    return lcm
```
This code uses the Euclidean algorithm to find the least common multiple of two integers. It first checks if one of the integers is greater than the other, and if so, uses that value as the starting point for the search. It then iterates through the integers starting from the greater value until it finds one that is divisible by both integers. This value is the least common multiple.

You can test this code with the following test cases:
```
print(lcm(12, 15)) # should return 60
print(lcm(12, 25)) # should return 150
print(lcm(12, 30)) # should return 60
```</s>  ```
def lcm(a, b):
    if a > b:
        greater = a
    else:
        greater = b
    while True:
        if (greater % a == 0) and (greater % b == 0):
            lcm = greater
            break
        greater += 1
    return lcm
