-------------------
  Here is a sample test suite for the `rolling_max` function:
```
{
    "test_case1": {
        "in": {
            "numbers": [1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 2]
        },
        "out": [1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]
    },
    "test_case2": {
        "in": {
            "numbers": [3, 2, 1, 4, 5, 7]
        },
        "out": [3, 3, 3, 4, 5, 7]
    },
    "test_case3": {
        "in": {
            "numbers": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

    },
    "test_case4": {

        },
        "out": [3, 3, 3, 4, 5, 7, 7]
    }
}
```
This test suite includes four test cases, each with a different input and expected output. The inputs are lists of integers, and the expected outputs are lists of integers that represent the rolling maximum elements found in the input sequence.</s>  Here is a possible implementation of the `rolling_max` function:
```
def rolling_max(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for i in range(len(numbers)):
        max_value = numbers[i]
        for j in range(i, len(numbers)):
            if numbers[j] > max_value:
                max_value = numbers[j]
        result.append(max_value)
    return result
```
This implementation uses a nested loop to iterate over the input list, and keeps track of the maximum value found so far. The outer loop iterates over the input list, and the inner loop iterates over the remaining part of the input list starting from the current index. At each iteration of the inner loop, the maximum value is updated if the current value is greater than the previous maximum value. The result is a list of the maximum values found at each point in the input list.</s>  ```
def rolling_max(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    max_val = None
    for num in numbers:
        if max_val is None or num > max_val:
            max_val = num
        result.append(max_val)
    return result
```</s>  Here's the code for the `rolling_max` function:
```
def rolling_max(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    current_max = 0
    for i in range(len(numbers)):
        current_max = max(current_max, numbers[i])
        result.append(current_max)
    return result
```
This code uses a sliding window approach, where we maintain a variable `current_max` that keeps track of the maximum value seen so far in the current window. We then append `current_max` to the result list at each iteration.

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the length of the input list, since we iterate over the list only once. The space complexity is also O(n), since we need to store the result list in memory.

Note that this code assumes that the input list is not empty, and that the elements in the list are all integers. If the input list is empty or if the elements are not integers, the code will raise a `TypeError` or a `ValueError`, respectively.</s>  ```
def rolling_max(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    current_max = None
    for num in numbers:
        if current_max is None or num > current_max:
            current_max = num
        result.append(current_max)
    return result
```
This code uses a simple loop to iterate through the input list and maintains a current maximum value. When a new element is encountered that is greater than the current maximum, the current maximum is updated and the new element is added to the result list. Otherwise, the current maximum is retained and the element is not added to the result list.

The `typing` module is used to specify the input and output types of the function. The `List[int]` type indicates that the input is a list of integers, and the `List[int]` type indicates that the output is a list of integers.

The `>>>` prompt is used to indicate that the code is a Python interactive session, and the `>>> rolling_max([1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 2])` line is the input to the function. The output of the function is `printed` on the next line.</s>  ```
def rolling_max(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    current_max = None
    for num in numbers:
        if current_max is None or num > current_max:
            current_max = num
        result.append(current_max)
    return result
```</s>  def rolling_max(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    current_max = float("-inf")
    for num in numbers:
        current_max = max(current_max, num)
        result.append(current_max)
    return result
[/CODE]

This code works by keeping track of the current maximum element found in the sequence so far, and updating it whenever a new element is encountered that is greater than the current maximum. The resulting list of maximum elements found until each moment in the sequence is returned.

For example, for the input list `[1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 2]`, the output list `[1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]` is generated as follows:

* `current_max` starts at `-inf` (since there are no initial maximum elements in the sequence).
* The first element `1` is encountered, so `current_max` is updated to `1`. The resulting list is `[1]`.
* The second element `2` is encountered, so `current_max` is updated to `2`. The resulting list is `[1, 2]`.
* The third element `3` is encountered, so `current_max` is updated to `3`. The resulting list is `[1, 2, 3]`.
* The fourth element `2` is encountered, so `current_max` is not updated (since `2` is not greater than `3`). The resulting list is `[1, 2, 3]`.
* The fifth element `3` is encountered, so `current_max` is updated to `3` (since `3` is greater than `3`). The resulting list is `[1, 2, 3, 3]`.
* The sixth element `4` is encountered, so `current_max` is updated to `4` (since `4` is greater than `3`). The resulting list is `[1, 2, 3, 3, 4]`.
* The seventh element `2` is encountered, so `current_max` is not updated (since `2` is not greater than `4`). The resulting list is `[1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4]`.

Note that the `float("-inf")` value is used to initialize `current_max` to a negative value, which ensures that the first element in the input list is always included in the resulting list, even if it is not the maximum element in the sequence.</s>  Here's the code for the `rolling_max` function:
```
def rolling_max(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    current_max = None
    for num in numbers:
        if current_max is None or num > current_max:
            current_max = num
        result.append(current_max)
    return result
```
This code uses a simple loop to iterate through the input list, and maintains a current maximum value that is appended to the result list as it is encountered. The `current_max` variable is initialized to `None`, which means that no maximum value has been found yet. As the loop progresses, the `current_max` variable is updated with the maximum value found so far, and the `result` list is updated with the current maximum value. The final `return` statement returns the `result` list, which contains the rolling maximum elements of the input list.</s>  Here is a possible implementation of the `rolling_max` function:
```
def rolling_max(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    current_max = 0
    for num in numbers:
        if num > current_max:
            current_max = num
        result.append(current_max)
    return result
```
This implementation uses a single variable `current_max` to keep track of the current maximum element found in the sequence, and appends this maximum element to the result list.

Note that the `rolling_max` function does not require any imports, as it only uses built-in Python types and functions.</s>  This is a classic interview question. The solution is to use a sliding window of size 2, and keep track of the maximum element in the window. Here is the code:
```
def rolling_max(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    max_window = 0
    for i in range(len(numbers)):
        max_window = max(max_window, numbers[i])
        result.append(max_window)
    return result
```
This code uses the built-in `max()` function to find the maximum element in the window, and then appends it to the result list. The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the length of the input list.</s>  def rolling_max(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    max_val = float("-inf")
    for num in numbers:
        max_val = max(max_val, num)
        result.append(max_val)
    return result</s>  This is a classic problem in algorithms, and the solution is quite simple using a sliding window. Here is the code:
```
def rolling_max(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    max_val = 0
    for i in range(len(numbers)):
        max_val = max(max_val, numbers[i])
        result.append(max_val)
    return result
```
This code iterates through the list of numbers and keeps track of the maximum value seen so far. It then appends the maximum value to the result list. The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input list.

It's worth noting that this solution is not optimal and there are more efficient algorithms for solving this problem. The most efficient algorithm is based on the idea of using a stack to keep track of the maximum values seen so far. This algorithm has a time complexity of O(n) and is much faster than the above solution for large input lists.

Here is the code for the stack-based solution:
```
def rolling_max(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    stack = []
    result = []
    for i in range(len(numbers)):
        if not stack or numbers[i] > stack[-1]:
            stack.append(numbers[i])
        else:
            stack.append(stack.pop())
        result.append(stack[-1])
    return result
```
This code uses a stack to keep track of the maximum values seen so far. It pushes the current maximum value onto the stack and pops the stack when the current value is less than the top value on the stack. This ensures that the stack always contains the maximum value seen so far. The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input list.</s>  def rolling_max(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    current_max = 0
    for i in range(len(numbers)):
        current_max = max(current_max, numbers[i])
        result.append(current_max)
    return result</s>  ```
def rolling_max(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    current_max = None
    for num in numbers:
        if current_max is None or num > current_max:
            current_max = num
        result.append(current_max)
    return result
```
This code uses a sliding window approach, where we maintain a current maximum value and update it whenever we encounter a new element in the list that is greater than the current maximum. We then append the current maximum to the result list.

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the length of the input list, since we iterate through the list only once and perform a single comparison for each element.

The space complexity is O(1), since we only use a single variable to store the current maximum value.</s>  Here's a possible implementation of the `rolling_max` function:
```
def rolling_max(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    current_max = None
    for num in numbers:
        if current_max is None or num > current_max:
            current_max = num
        result.append(current_max)
    return result
```
This function takes a list of integers `numbers` as input, and returns a list of the same length, where each element is the maximum value found in the input list up to that point.

Here's an example usage of the `rolling_max` function:
```
>>> numbers = [1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 2]
>>> rolling_max(numbers)
[1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]
```
In this example, the `rolling_max` function returns a list where each element is the maximum value in the input list up to that point. The first element in the output list is 1, since 1 is the maximum value in the input list up to that point. The second element in the output list is 2, since 2 is the maximum value in the input list up to that point. And so on.</s>  ```
def rolling_max(numbers):
    result = []
    current_max = None
    for i in range(len(numbers)):
        if current_max is None or numbers[i] > current_max:
            current_max = numbers[i]
        result.append(current_max)
    return result
```</s>  ```
def rolling_max(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    current_max = None
    for num in numbers:
        if current_max is None or num > current_max:
            current_max = num
        result.append(current_max)
    return result
```</s>  Sure, here's the code for the `rolling_max` function:
```
def rolling_max(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    current_max = None
    for num in numbers:
        if current_max is None or num > current_max:
            current_max = num
        result.append(current_max)
    return result
```
This code uses a simple loop to iterate through the input list of integers. It keeps track of the current maximum element found so far, and appends it to the result list at each iteration. If the current element is greater than the current maximum, it becomes the new maximum.

Note that the function takes a `List[int]` as input and returns a `List[int]`. Also, the function is written in a way that it can handle any sequence of integers, not just a list.</s>  ```
def rolling_max(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    max_so_far = float("-inf")
    for num in numbers:
        max_so_far = max(max_so_far, num)
        result.append(max_so_far)
    return result
```</s>  ```
def rolling_max(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    current_max = None
    for num in numbers:
        if current_max is None or num > current_max:
            current_max = num
        result.append(current_max)
    return result
```
This code uses a simple sliding window approach, where we keep track of the current maximum element seen so far, and append it to the result list. When a new element is encountered, we compare it to the current maximum and update it if necessary. The resulting list contains the rolling maximum elements found until the current moment in the sequence.</s>  Sure, here's a Python code sample that solves the given coding problem:
```
from typing import List, Tuple

def rolling_max(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    max_value = None
    for i in range(len(numbers)):
        if max_value is None or numbers[i] > max_value:
            max_value = numbers[i]
        result.append(max_value)
    return result
```
This code uses a simple loop to iterate over the input list of integers, and keeps track of the maximum value seen so far using a variable `max_value`. Whenever the current element is greater than the previous maximum value, the current element is assigned to `max_value`, and the result list is updated with the current maximum value.

The `range` function is used to iterate over the input list, and the `len` function is used to get the length of the list.

The `List` and `Tuple` types are imported from the `typing` module, which is used to define the type hints for the function parameters and return value.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.</s>
