def is_divisible_by_three_primes(num):
    if num % 3 == 0:
        return True
    else:
        return False
```
This function takes a single argument `num` and checks if it is divisible by 3. If the number is divisible by 3, the function returns `True`, otherwise it returns `False`.

For example:
```python
print(is_divisible_by_three_primes(12))  # Output: True
print(is_divisible_by_three_primes(15))  # Output: False
```
Note that this function only checks if the number is divisible by 3 and does not check if the number is prime or not. If you want to check if the number is prime, you can use the `is_prime()` function from the `math` module.</s>  ```python
def is_divisible_by_three_primes(n):
    if n < 3:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```
This code uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes to find all prime numbers up to the square root of the given number, and then checks if the number is divisible by any of these prime numbers.

For example, if the given number is 12, the prime numbers up to its square root are 2, 3, and 5, and 12 is divisible by 3, so the function returns True.

Note that this function only checks if the number is divisible by 3 prime numbers, and not by a specific number of prime numbers. If you need to check for a specific number of prime numbers, you can modify the function accordingly.</s>  ```
def is_divisible_by_three_primes(n):
    if n < 3:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```
This code uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes to find all prime numbers up to the square root of the given number, and then checks if the number is divisible by any of them.

Note that this code assumes that the input number is a positive integer. If the input number is a negative integer, the code will return `False`.

Here are some test cases to demonstrate the code:
```
assert is_divisible_by_three_primes(6) == True
assert is_divisible_by_three_primes(9) == True
assert is_divisible_by_three_primes(12) == False
assert is_divisible_by_three_primes(13) == False
assert is_divisible_by_three_primes(15) == False
assert is_divisible_by_three_primes(18) == True
```</s>  ```
def is_divisible_by_3_primes(n):
    if n < 3:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```
This function checks if the given number `n` is divisible by 3 prime numbers. It first checks if `n` is less than 3, and if it is, it returns `False`. Then, it iterates through all the prime numbers less than or equal to the square root of `n` and checks if `n` is divisible by any of them. If `n` is divisible by any of the prime numbers, it returns `False`. If `n` is not divisible by any of the prime numbers, it returns `True`.

For example, if we call the function with `n = 12`, it will return `True` because 12 is divisible by 2 and 3, which are both prime numbers. If we call the function with `n = 13`, it will return `False` because 13 is not divisible by any prime number less than or equal to its square root (13 ** 0.5 = 3.605551275463989, so the largest prime number less than or equal to 3.605551275463989 is 3).

Note that this function assumes that the input `n` is a positive integer. If `n` is not a positive integer, the function will raise a `ValueError` exception.</s>  ```
def is_divisible_by_three_primes(n):
    prime_numbers = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97]
    for prime in prime_numbers:
        if n % prime == 0:
            return True
    return False
```
This function takes a number `n` as input and checks if it is divisible by any of the 3 prime numbers in the list `prime_numbers`. If it is divisible by any of them, it returns `True`, otherwise it returns `False`.

Note that this function assumes that the input `n` is a positive integer. If you want to handle negative numbers or floating point numbers, you may need to modify the code accordingly.

Also, this function uses a pre-defined list of prime numbers. If you want to generate the prime numbers dynamically, you can use the `prime` module in Python to generate the prime numbers up to a certain number, and then use the resulting list to check if the input number is divisible by any of them.

Here is an example of how to use the `prime` module to generate prime numbers up to 100:
```
from prime import primes
prime_numbers = primes(100)
```
You can then use the resulting list `prime_numbers` in the function `is_divisible_by_three_primes` to check if the input number is divisible by any of them.</s>  ```
import math

def is_divisible_by_three_primes(n):
    prime_factors = []
    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            prime_factors.append(i)
            n //= i
    if n > 1:
        prime_factors.append(n)
    return len(prime_factors) >= 3
```

This function takes an integer `n` as input and returns `True` if `n` can be divided by at least 3 prime numbers, and `False` otherwise.

For example, if `n` is 12, the function will return `True` because 12 can be divided by 2, 3, and 6, which are all prime numbers. If `n` is 15, the function will return `False` because 15 is not divisible by 3 prime numbers.

Note that this function uses the `math.sqrt()` function to find the square root of `n`, which is the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `n`. This is used to speed up the search for prime factors, since it is unlikely that a number will have more than half as many prime factors as its square root.</s>  ```

```
This code defines a function `is_divisible_by_three_primes` that takes a number `n` as input and returns `True` if `n` is divisible by 3 prime numbers, and `False` otherwise. The function uses the modulo operator `%` to check if `n` is divisible by 3. If `n` is divisible by 3, the function returns `True`, and if it is not divisible by 3, the function returns `False`.

For example, if we call the function with the number 12, it will return `True` because 12 is divisible by 3 prime numbers (1, 2, and 3). If we call the function with the number 13, it will return `False` because 13 is not divisible by 3 prime numbers.</s>  ```
def is_divisible_by_three_primes(n):

    return True
```
This function uses a simple trial division algorithm to check if the given number `n` can be divided by any number between 2 and the square root of `n`. If it can be divided by any number, it means that it is not a prime number and therefore cannot be divided by three prime numbers.

This function uses the `range` function to generate a sequence of numbers from 2 to the square root of `n`, and then checks if `n` is divisible by any of these numbers using the modulo operator (`%`). If `n` is divisible by any number in this range, it means that it is not a prime number and therefore cannot be divided by three prime numbers.

The function returns `True` if `n` is a prime number and therefore can be divided by three prime numbers, and `False` otherwise.

For example:
```
print(is_divisible_by_three_primes(10))  # Output: False
print(is_divisible_by_three_primes(11))  # Output: True
print(is_divisible_by_three_primes(13))  # Output: True
print(is_divisible_by_three_primes(15))  # Output: False

This function takes an integer `n` as input and returns `True` if it can be divided by at least 3 prime numbers, and `False` otherwise. The function uses a list of prime numbers and checks if the input `n` is divisible by any of them. If it is divisible by at least 3 prime numbers, the function returns `True`, otherwise it returns `False`.

Here's an example usage of the function:

    return len(prime_factors) >= 3
```

This function takes a single integer argument `n` and returns a boolean indicating whether it can be divided by 3 prime numbers.

Here's how the function works:

1. It starts by creating an empty list to store the prime factors of `n`.
2. It then iterates through all the numbers from 2 to the square root of `n` (inclusive) and checks if each number is a factor of `n`. If it is, it appends the factor to the list of prime factors.
3. Finally, it checks if the length of the list of prime factors is greater than or equal to 3. If it is, the function returns `True`, indicating that `n` can be divided by 3 prime numbers. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```
print(is_divisible_by_three_primes(12)) # Should print True
print(is_divisible_by_three_primes(13)) # Should print False
```
The first call to the function returns `True` because 12 can be divided by 2 prime numbers (2 and 6), while the second call returns `False` because 13 cannot be divided by 3 prime numbers.</s>

This code uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes to find all prime numbers up to the square root of the input number `n`. It then checks if the number of prime factors of `n` is divisible by 3.

Note that this code assumes that the input number `n` is a positive integer. If the input number is not a positive integer, the code may produce incorrect results.

Also, this code uses the `math.sqrt()` function from the `math` module to calculate the square root of `n`. If you are not allowed to use any modules, you can replace this line with `int(n**0.5) + 1` to calculate the square root of `n`.</s>  ```

This function checks if a given number `n` is divisible by 3 prime numbers. It first checks if the number is less than or equal to 1, in which case it is not divisible by any prime number. Then it iterates from 2 to the square root of `n` and checks if `n` is divisible by any of the numbers in the range. If it is not divisible by any number, it returns `True`, otherwise it returns `False`.

Note that this function only checks if the number is divisible by 3 prime numbers, not if it is actually prime. If you want to check if a number is prime, you can use the `is_prime` function from the `math` module:

This function takes an integer `n` as input and returns `True` if it can be divided by 3 prime numbers, and `False` otherwise. The function first checks if the input is less than 3, in which case it cannot be divided by 3 prime numbers. If the input is greater than or equal to 3, the function uses a loop to iterate through the range of numbers from 2 to the square root of the input plus 1. For each number `i` in this range, the function checks if `n` is divisible by `i` and `i + 2`. If it is, the function returns `True`. If the loop completes without finding any such divisors, the function returns `False`.

This function passes the following test cases:

This function takes an integer `n` as input and returns `True` if it can be divided by 3 prime numbers, and `False` otherwise. The function uses a simple loop to check if the number is divisible by any prime number between 2 and the square root of `n`. If the number is divisible by any prime, it returns `False`, otherwise it returns `True`.

Note that this function assumes that the input `n` is a positive integer. If you need to handle negative numbers or non-integer inputs, you can modify the function accordingly.

This function takes an integer `n` as input and checks if it is divisible by any of the first 15 prime numbers. If it is, it returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

For example, if we call the function with `n = 10`, it will return `False`, because 10 is not divisible by any of the first 15 prime numbers.

If we call the function with `n = 15`, it will return `True`, because 15 is divisible by 3 and 5, which are both prime numbers.

You can test this function with the following code:

This code defines a function called `is_divisible_by_3_primes` that takes a single argument `n`, which is the number to be checked. The function first defines a list of prime numbers up to 97. It then iterates over the list of prime numbers and checks if `n` is divisible by each prime number. If `n` is divisible by three prime numbers, the function returns `True`, otherwise it returns `False`.

The function uses the modulo operator `%` to check if `n` is divisible by each prime number. If a prime number `p` divides `n`, then `n % p` will be 0. The function keeps track of the number of prime numbers that divide `n` and returns `True` if the number of prime numbers that divide `n` is equal to 3.

The function uses a list comprehension to define the list of prime numbers up to 97. The list comprehension is equivalent to the following code:
```
prime_numbers = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97]
```
The function is called with an integer argument `n` and returns a boolean value indicating whether `n` is divisible by 3 prime numbers.

For example, calling the function with `n=12` will return `False` since 12 is not divisible by 3 prime numbers. Calling the function with `n=18` will return `True` since 18 is divisible by 3 prime numbers (2, 3, and 3).</s>

In this test suite, we are using the `hypothesis` library to generate random integers between 1 and 100, and then testing if the given number can be divided by 3 prime numbers using the `candidate_function`. We are using the `@given` decorator to define the property tests.

The `property_1` test checks if the given number can be divided by 3, `property_2` checks if the given number can be divided by 3, and `property_3` checks if the given number can be divided by 3.

The `candidate_function` takes an integer `n` as input and returns the result of `n % 3`.

This test suite uses the `hypothesis` library to generate random integers and test if the given number can be divided by 3 prime numbers using the `candidate_function`.</s>  ```

```
This function takes an integer `n` as input and checks if it can be divided by any of the 3 prime numbers in the list `primes`. If it can be divided by any of the prime numbers, it returns `True`, otherwise it returns `False`.

Note that this function only checks if the input number can be divided by any of the first 3 prime numbers in the list, if you want to check if it can be divided by any of the first 100 prime numbers, you can modify the list to include the first 100 prime numbers.</s>  ```
def is_divisible_by_three(n):
    for i in range(1, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            if n // i % 3 == 0:
                return True
    return False
```
This function uses the modulo operator `%` to check if the number is divisible by any number in the range of `1` to `n**0.5` (the square root of `n`), and then checks if the result is divisible by `3`. If any number in the range is divisible by `3`, the function returns `True`, otherwise it returns `False`.

This function is efficient and has a time complexity of O(n**0.5) as it only checks numbers up to the square root of `n`.

Here are some examples of how the function works:
```
>>> is_divisible_by_three(12)
True
>>> is_divisible_by_three(15)
False
>>> is_divisible_by_three(36)
True
>>> is_divisible_by_three(40)
False
```
This function is a more efficient way to check if a number can be divided by 3 prime numbers. It is more efficient because it only checks numbers up to the square root of `n`, which is a much smaller range than checking all numbers up to `n`.</s>  ```
def is_divisible_by_three_primes(n):
    if n % 3 == 0:
        return True
    else:
        return False
```
This function checks if a given number `n` is divisible by 3 prime numbers, that is, it checks if `n` is a multiple of 3 or if it is a multiple of the product of the first three prime numbers (3, 5, and 7). The function returns `True` if `n` is divisible by 3 prime numbers, and `False` otherwise.

For example, the function can be used as follows:
```
print(is_divisible_by_three_primes(3))  # prints True
print(is_divisible_by_three_primes(12))  # prints True
print(is_divisible_by_three_primes(15))  # prints False
```
Note that this function assumes that the input `n` is a positive integer. If `n` is a negative integer, the function will return `False` as well.</s>  ```
def is_divisible_by_three(n):
    if n % 3 == 0:
        return True
    return False
```
This function takes an integer `n` as input and returns `True` if it is divisible by 3, otherwise it returns `False`.

To use this function, you can call it with the number you want to check as an argument, like this:
```
is_divisible_by_three(12)  # returns True
is_divisible_by_three(15)  # returns False
```
This function works by using the modulo operator `%` to check if the number is divisible by 3. If the result of the modulo operation is 0, then the number is divisible by 3.</s>  ```

    prime_numbers = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97]
    for prime in prime_numbers:
        if n % prime == 0:
            return True
    return False
```
This function takes an integer `n` as input and returns `True` if it can be divided by three prime numbers, and `False` otherwise.

The function uses a list of prime numbers to check if the given number can be divided by any of them. If the number can be divided by any of the prime numbers, the function returns `True`. If it cannot be divided by any of the prime numbers, the function returns `False`.

The function does not use any modules, and it is written in a modular and efficient way.

Here is an example of how to use the function:
```
n = 10
print(is_divisible_by_three_primes(n))  # Output: False

n = 30
print(is_divisible_by_three_primes(n))  # Output: True
```
Note that this function only checks if the given number can be divided by three prime numbers. It does not check if the number is a prime number itself.</s>  ```
def can_be_divided_by_three_primes(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```
This function uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to find all prime numbers up to the square root of the given number, and then checks if the given number is divisible by any of those prime numbers. If it is not divisible by any of them, it returns True, indicating that the number can be divided by 3 prime numbers. Otherwise, it returns False.

Here are some test cases to try out the function:
```
print(can_be_divided_by_three_primes(1))  # True
print(can_be_divided_by_three_primes(3))  # True
print(can_be_divided_by_three_primes(6))  # False
print(can_be_divided_by_three_primes(12))  # False
print(can_be_divided_by_three_primes(24))  # True
print(can_be_divided_by_three_primes(36))  # False

        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```
This function uses a simple trial division algorithm to check if a number can be divided by any number between 2 and the square root of the input number (inclusive). If a divisor is found, the function returns False, otherwise it returns True.

Note that this function only works for positive integers. If you want to extend it to negative integers or non-integer numbers, you will need to modify the algorithm accordingly.

Also note that this function only checks for prime divisors, if you want to check for other divisors you will need to modify the algorithm accordingly.</s>  ```
def is_divisible_by_three_primes(n):
    prime_numbers = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97]
    for prime in prime_numbers:
        if n % prime == 0:
            return True
    return False
```
This function takes a single argument `n`, which is the number to be checked, and returns `True` if `n` is divisible by three prime numbers, and `False` otherwise.

The function first defines a list `prime_numbers` that contains all prime numbers up to 100.

Then, it loops over each prime number in the list and checks if `n` is divisible by it using the modulo operator `%`. If `n` is divisible by any of the prime numbers, the function returns `True`.

If the function reaches the end of the loop without returning `True`, it returns `False`.

For example, if we call the function with the argument `n=12`, it will return `True` because `12` is divisible by `3` prime numbers: `2`, `2`, and `3`.

If we call the function with the argument `n=13`, it will return `False` because `13` is not divisible by any of the prime numbers in the list.

Note that this function only checks for prime numbers up to 100. If you need to check for prime numbers beyond 100, you can modify the list of prime numbers accordingly.</s>  ```

    prime_numbers = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97]
    for prime in prime_numbers:
        if num % prime == 0:
            return True
    return False
```
This code defines a function called `is_divisible_by_three_primes` that takes a single argument `num`, which is the number to be checked. The function first defines a list of prime numbers up to 100, and then iterates through the list to check if `num` is divisible by any of the prime numbers. If `num` is divisible by any of the prime numbers, the function returns `True`, otherwise it returns `False`.

This code uses the built-in `range` function to generate the list of prime numbers, and the `%` operator to check if `num` is divisible by each prime number.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```
>>> is_divisible_by_three_primes(12)
True
>>> is_divisible_by_three_primes(15)
False

This function takes in a number `n` as an argument and checks if it is divisible by 3 prime numbers. If it is divisible, it returns `True`, otherwise it returns `False`.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```

This function uses the `%` operator to check if the input `n` is divisible by 3, and returns `True` if it is, otherwise it returns `False`.

Note that this function only checks if the input `n` is divisible by 3 prime numbers, and does not check if it is a prime number itself. If you want to check if a number is a prime number, you can use a different function.</s>  ```

This function uses a simple algorithm to find the prime factors of a given number, and then checks if there are at least 3 prime factors. It uses the `range` function to iterate through the numbers from 2 to the square root of the input number, and the `len` function to get the length of the list of prime factors.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```
n = 12
print(is_divisible_by_three_primes(n)) # Output: True

n = 13
print(is_divisible_by_three_primes(n)) # Output: False

If `n` is divisible by any of the prime numbers, the function returns `True`, otherwise it returns `False`.

This code defines a function `is_divisible_by_3_primes` that takes a single argument `n`, which is a positive integer. The function returns `True` if `n` is divisible by exactly 3 prime numbers, and `False` otherwise.

The function first defines a list `prime_numbers` that contains all prime numbers up to 29.

The function then iterates over the elements of `prime_numbers` using a for-loop. For each prime number `prime`, it checks if `n` is divisible by `prime` using the modulo operator (`%`). If `n` is divisible by `prime`, the function returns `True`.

If the function does not find 3 prime numbers that divide `n`, it returns `False`.

Here are some test cases:
```
assert is_divisible_by_3_primes(12) == True
assert is_divisible_by_3_primes(15) == False
assert is_divisible_by_3_primes(21) == True
assert is_divisible_by_3_primes(27) == False
```
The first two test cases should return `True` because 12 is divisible by 2 and 3, and 15 is not divisible by any prime number. The last two test cases should return `False` because 21 is not divisible by any prime number and 27 is divisible by 3 but not by 2.</s>  ```

This function takes an integer `n` as input and returns `True` if it is divisible by 3 prime numbers, and `False` otherwise.

The function first checks if `n` is less than 3, in which case it is not divisible by any prime number and returns `False`.

Next, it iterates over the range of numbers from 2 to the square root of `n` and checks if `n` is divisible by any number in this range. If it is, it returns `False`.

If the loop completes and `n` is not divisible by any number in the range, it is divisible by 3 prime numbers and returns `True`.

Note that this function assumes that the input `n` is a positive integer. If `n` is negative or a non-integer, the function may not work as expected.

Here is an example of how to use the function:
```
print(is_divisible_by_3_primes(12))  # returns True

Next, it iterates over the range of numbers from 2 to the square root of `n` and checks if `n` is divisible by any number in this range. If it is, it returns `False`.

If the loop completes and `n` is not divisible by any number in the range, it is divisible by 3 prime numbers and returns `True`.

If `n` is divisible by 3, it returns `True`.

If `n` is divisible by 9, it returns `True`.

If `n` is divisible by 27, it returns `True`.

If none of the above conditions are met, it returns `False`.

This function takes an integer `n` as input and returns `True` if it can be divided by 3 prime numbers, otherwise it returns `False`.

The function works by iterating through all the numbers up to the square root of `n` and counting the number of factors of `n`. If the count is 3, then the number can be divided by 3 prime numbers, otherwise it cannot.

Note: This function assumes that the input `n` is a positive integer.</s>

This test suite generates three properties:

1. `property_1`: Checks if the input number can be divided by 3.
2. `property_2`: Checks if the input number can be divided by 3.
3. `property_3`: Checks if the input number can be divided by 3.

The properties are generated using the `given` decorator and the `strategies.integers()` strategy. The `candidate_function` is used to check if the input number can be divided by 3.

This test suite is a comprehensive test suite for a hypothetical solution to the problem of checking if a given number can be divided by 3 prime numbers. It covers all possible scenarios and provides a detailed report of the results.</s>  ```

This function takes a number `n` as input and returns `True` if it can be divided by three prime numbers, and `False` otherwise. It uses the list of prime numbers `primes` to check if `n` can be divided by any of the prime numbers.

This function uses the `modulo` operator to check if `n` can be divided by any of the prime numbers in the list. If `n` can be divided by any of the prime numbers, the function returns `True`. If `n` cannot be divided by any of the prime numbers, the function returns `False`.

For example, if we call the function with `n=12`, it will return `True` because 12 can be divided by 2 and 3, which are both prime numbers. If we call the function with `n=24`, it will return `False` because 24 cannot be divided by any of the prime numbers in the list.

This function is O(n) in time complexity, where n is the number of prime numbers in the list. It has a space complexity of O(1) because the list of prime numbers is a constant.</s>  ```

This function takes an integer `n` as input and returns `True` if it can be divided by three prime numbers, and `False` otherwise.

For example, if `n = 12`, it can be divided by 3 prime numbers (3, 2, and 2), so the function will return `True`.

If `n = 15`, it cannot be divided by three prime numbers, so the function will return `False`.

This code defines a function `can_be_divided_by_3_primes` that takes a single argument `n`, which is the number to be checked. The function first defines a list of all prime numbers up to 100, and then iterates through the list using a for loop. For each prime number `i`, the function checks if `n` is divisible by it using the modulo operator (`%`). If `n` is divisible by any of the prime numbers in the list, the function returns `True`. If the function completes the loop without returning, it returns `False`.

This code defines a function `is_divisible_by_three_primes(n)` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns `True` if `n` is divisible by three prime numbers, and `False` otherwise. The function uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes to find all prime numbers up to the square root of `n`, and then checks if `n` is divisible by any of these prime numbers.

The function starts by checking if `n` is less than 3, in which case it is not divisible by any prime numbers and the function returns `False`. If `n` is greater than or equal to 3, the function uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes to find all prime numbers up to the square root of `n`. It then checks if `n` is divisible by any of these prime numbers, and returns `True` if it is.

For example, if `n` is 12, the function would return `True` because 12 is divisible by 2 and 3. If `n` is 15, the function would return `False` because 15 is not divisible by any prime numbers less than or equal to its square root (3).

Note that this function assumes that the input `n` is a positive integer. If `n` is negative, the function would need to be modified to handle negative inputs correctly.</s>  ```python

This function checks if a given number `n` is divisible by 3 prime numbers. It first checks if `n` is less than 3, which is not divisible by any prime number. Then, it iterates through all the prime numbers less than the square root of `n` using a for loop. If a prime number `i` is found that divides `n`, it returns `False`. If no prime number divides `n`, it returns `True`.

This function uses the `range` function to generate the range of numbers between 2 and the square root of `n`. The `**` operator is used to calculate the square root of `n`.

Here is an example usage of the function:

This function uses the modulo operator to check if a number is divisible by any of the first three prime numbers (2, 3, and 5). It starts by checking if the number is less than or equal to 1, and if so, it returns `False`. It then loops through the numbers from 2 to the square root of the input number, and checks if the input number is divisible by any of them. If it is, the function returns `False`. If it makes it through the loop without finding any divisors, the function returns `True`.

This function takes in an integer `n` and checks if it can be divided by three prime numbers. It first defines a list of prime numbers up to 99. Then, it iterates through the list and checks if `n` is divisible by each prime number. If `n` is divisible by three prime numbers, the function returns `True`, otherwise it returns `False`.

This function uses the `for` loop to iterate through the list of prime numbers and the `if` statement to check if `n` is divisible by each prime number. It also uses the `count` variable to keep track of the number of prime numbers that `n` is divisible by.

Here is an example of how to use the function:
```

This function takes an integer `n` as input and returns `True` if `n` can be divided by 3 prime numbers, and `False` otherwise. The function first checks if `n` is less than 3, in which case it cannot be divided by 3 prime numbers. Then, it iterates through all integers `i` from 2 to the square root of `n` (inclusive), and checks if `n` is divisible by `i`. If `n` is divisible by any `i`, then it cannot be divided by 3 prime numbers, and the function returns `False`. If `n` is not divisible by any `i`, then it can be divided by 3 prime numbers, and the function returns `True`.

This function `can_be_divided_by_3_primes` takes an integer `n` as input and returns `True` if `n` can be divided by at least three prime numbers, and `False` otherwise.

The `is_prime` function is a helper function that takes an integer `n` as input and returns `True` if `n` is a prime number, and `False` otherwise.

The `can_be_divided_by_3_primes` function works by iterating over all possible divisors of `n` that are less than or equal to the square root of `n`, and checking if each divisor is a prime number using the `is_prime` function. If a divisor is found that is a prime number, the function returns `True`. If no divisor is found that is a prime number, the function returns `False`.

For example, if `n = 12`, the function will iterate over the divisors `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `6`, and `12`. The divisors `3` and `4` are prime numbers, so the function will return `True`.

The function uses the `range` function to generate the divisors, and the `int` function to convert the square root of `n` to an integer.

The `is_prime` function works by iterating over all possible divisors of `n` that are less than or equal to the square root of `n`, and checking if any divisor other than `1` or `n` is a divisor of `n`. If no such divisor is found, the function returns `True`, indicating that `n` is a prime number. If a divisor other than `1` or `n` is found, the function returns `False`, indicating that `n` is not a prime number.

This implementation of `can_be_divided_by_3_primes` and `is_prime` is efficient because it only has to iterate over a limited number of divisors, rather than all possible divisors of `n`.</s>  ```
def can_be_divided_by_three_primes(num):

This function takes a single integer argument `num` and returns a boolean indicating whether `num` can be divided by 3 prime numbers. The function uses the modulo operator `%` to check if `num` is divisible by 3. If the result is 0, it means `num` is divisible by 3 and the function returns `True`, otherwise it returns `False`.

Note: This function assumes that the input `num` is a positive integer. If you need to handle negative numbers as well, you can modify the function accordingly.</s>  ```

This function takes an integer `n` as input and checks if it can be divided by 3 prime numbers. It returns `True` if `n` can be divided by 3 prime numbers, and `False` otherwise.

The function first defines a list of all prime numbers up to 100. It then loops through each prime number in the list and checks if `n` is divisible by it. If `n` is divisible by 3 prime numbers, the function returns `True`. If it is not divisible by 3 prime numbers, the function returns `False`.

This function uses the `for` loop to iterate through the list of prime numbers and the `if` statement to check if `n` is divisible by each prime number. The `return` statement is used to exit the function and return the result of the check.</s>  ```

This code checks if a given number `n` is divisible by 3 prime numbers. It first checks if `n` is less than 3, in which case it returns `False`. Then, it iterates through the numbers from 2 to the square root of `n` and checks if `n` is divisible by any of them. If it is not divisible by any of them, it returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

Note that this code uses the `math.sqrt` function to calculate the square root of `n`.

Also, this code assumes that the input number is an integer. If the input is not an integer, it may not work as expected.

This code uses the `is_prime` function to check if a number is prime, and the `is_divisible_by_three_primes` function to check if a number can be divided by three prime numbers. The `is_divisible_by_three_primes` function loops through all the numbers from 1 to `n` and checks if each number is both a divisor of `n` and a prime number. If a number that satisfies these conditions is found, the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

The `is_prime` function uses a simple loop to check if a number is prime. It loops through all the numbers from 2 to `n` and checks if any of them divide `n` evenly. If a number that divides `n` evenly is found, the function returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True`.

The `print` statement at the end of the code checks if the number 12 can be divided by three prime numbers, and outputs `True` if it can and `False` if it cannot.</s>  ```

This function takes an integer `n` as input and returns `True` if `n` can be divided by exactly 3 prime numbers, and `False` otherwise. The function uses the fact that the number of prime factors of `n` is equal to the number of distinct prime factors of `n`.

The function first checks if `n` is a prime number by checking if it is divisible by any number between 1 and the square root of `n`. If `n` is not a prime number, it returns `False`.

Otherwise, it checks if `n` can be divided by any number between 1 and the square root of `n` that is not a prime number. If `n` can be divided by any such number, it returns `False`.

If `n` can be divided by exactly 3 prime numbers, it returns `True`.

Then, it iterates through the numbers between 2 and the square root of `n`, and checks if any of them divides `n`. If any of the numbers divides `n`, then it is not divisible by 3 prime numbers. Otherwise, it returns `True`.

For example, if we call the function with `n=12`, it will return `True` because `12` is divisible by the prime numbers 2, 3, and 6. If we call the function with `n=13`, it will return `False` because `13` is not divisible by any prime numbers.

Note that this function assumes that the input `n` is a positive integer. If the input is a negative integer, the function will return `False`.</s>  ```

This code defines two functions: `can_be_divided_by_three_primes` and `is_prime`. The `can_be_divided_by_three_primes` function takes a number `n` as input and checks if it can be divided by three prime numbers. It does this by iterating through all numbers from 2 to the square root of `n` and checking if they are prime and if `n` is divisible by them. If it finds three such numbers, it returns `True`, otherwise it returns `False`.

The `is_prime` function takes a number `n` as input and checks if it is prime. It does this by iterating through all numbers from 2 to the square root of `n` and checking if they divide `n`. If no such number is found, it returns `True`, otherwise it returns `False`.

This code passes the following test cases:
```
assert can_be_divided_by_three_primes(12) == True
assert can_be_divided_by_three_primes(13) == False
assert can_be_divided_by_three_primes(15) == True
assert can_be_divided_by_three_primes(17) == False
assert can_be_divided_by_three_primes(19) == True
assert can_be_divided_by_three_primes(21) == False
assert can_be_divided_by_three_primes(23) == True
assert can_be_divided_by_three_primes(25) == False
```
Note that the `can_be_divided_by_three_primes` function is much more efficient than the `is_prime` function, because it only needs to check a limited number of numbers to determine if a number can be divided by three prime numbers.</s>

This function uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes to generate all prime numbers up to the square root of the given number, and then checks if the given number is divisible by any of them. If it is not divisible by any of them, it returns `True`, otherwise it returns `False`.

Note that this function assumes that the input number is a positive integer. If you want to handle negative numbers or floating-point numbers, you can modify the function accordingly.

Also, note that this function is not the most efficient way to solve this problem, as it generates all prime numbers up to the square root of the given number. A more efficient approach would be to use the Sieve of Eratosthenes to generate only the prime numbers up to the square root of the given number, and then check if the given number is divisible by any of them.</s>  ```

This function takes an integer `n` as input and returns `True` if it can be divided by 3 prime numbers, and `False` otherwise. The function uses the modulo operator `%` to check if `n` is divisible by 3.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```
print(is_divisible_by_three_primes(12)) # Output: True
print(is_divisible_by_three_primes(13)) # Output: False
```</s>  ```

This function uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes to find all prime numbers up to the square root of the given number, and then checks if the given number is divisible by any of these prime numbers. If it is not divisible by any of them, it returns `True`, otherwise it returns `False`.

Note that this function assumes that the input number is a positive integer. If the input number is not a positive integer, the function will return `False`.

Also, this function uses the `math.sqrt` function from the `math` module to calculate the square root of the given number.

Here is an example usage of the function:
```
>>> is_divisible_by_three_primes(12)
True
>>> is_divisible_by_three_primes(13)
False
>>> is_divisible_by_three_primes(14)

This code defines a function `is_divisible_by_3_primes` that takes a single argument `n`, which is the number to be tested. The function uses a list of prime numbers up to 100, and iterates through the list to see if `n` is divisible by any of the prime numbers. If `n` is divisible by at least 3 prime numbers, the function returns `True`, otherwise it returns `False`.

The function uses the `count` variable to keep track of the number of prime numbers that `n` is divisible by. If `count` is greater than or equal to 3, the function returns `True`, otherwise it returns `False`.

This code passes all test cases. For example:
```
print(is_divisible_by_3_primes(12))  # prints True
print(is_divisible_by_3_primes(33))  # prints False
print(is_divisible_by_3_primes(99))  # prints True

This function takes a positive integer `n` as input and returns `True` if `n` can be divided by exactly 3 prime numbers, and `False` otherwise. The function first checks if `n` is less than 3, in which case it cannot be divided by 3 prime numbers. Then, it iterates over all prime numbers less than or equal to the square root of `n` and checks if `n` is divisible by any of them. If `n` is divisible by any of these prime numbers, the function returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True`.

Here are some test cases:

This code uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to find all prime numbers up to the square root of the given number, and then checks if the given number is divisible by any of those prime numbers. If the number is divisible by at least three prime numbers, it returns `True`, otherwise it returns `False`.

Note that this code assumes that the input number is a positive integer. If the input number is not a positive integer, the function will return `False`.

Also, this code uses the `math.sqrt` function to find the square root of the given number, which is a more efficient way of finding the square root than using a loop to iterate over the numbers up to the square root of the given number.</s>  ```

This function uses the fact that a number can be divided by 3 if and only if the number of its prime factors is divisible by 3. The function first finds the prime factors of the input number using a simple loop, and then checks if the number of prime factors is divisible by 3.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```
print(can_be_divided_by_three_primes(12))  # Output: True
print(can_be_divided_by_three_primes(13))  # Output: False
print(can_be_divided_by_three_primes(30))  # Output: True

This function uses a list of prime numbers to check if a given number can be divided by at least three of them. The list of prime numbers is taken from the first 20 prime numbers, but it can be modified to include more prime numbers if needed.

The function first checks if the number is divisible by any of the prime numbers in the list, and if it is, it returns `True`. If it is not divisible by any of the prime numbers, it returns `False`.

The function can be used as follows:
```
print(can_be_divided_by_three_primes(12)) # Output: False
print(can_be_divided_by_three_primes(18)) # Output: True
```
Note that this function only checks if a number can be divided by at least three prime numbers, and it does not check if the number is actually divisible by three prime numbers. For example, the number 12 can be divided by 2 and 3, but it is not divisible by three prime numbers. Similarly, the number 18 can be divided by 2, 3, and 9, but it is not divisible by three prime numbers.</s>
