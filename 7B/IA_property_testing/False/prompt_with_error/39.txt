3. The function should return a multiple of 3 if the input is a multiple of 3.
4. The function should return a multiple of 5 if the input is a multiple of 5.</s>  ```

This code uses the Fibonacci sequence to generate prime Fibonacci numbers. It starts with a and b equal to 0 and 1, and then iteratively adds a and b, checking if the result is prime and if it is a Fibonacci number. If it is both prime and a Fibonacci number, it returns the result. If the loop completes without finding a prime Fibonacci number, it returns None.

The is_prime function checks if a number is prime by iterating from 2 to the square root of the number and checking if it is divisible by any of the numbers between 2 and the square root of the number. If the number is not divisible by any of these numbers, it is prime.</s>  ```

This code uses the Fibonacci sequence to find the n-th prime Fibonacci number. It first finds the n-th Fibonacci number using the Fibonacci sequence, and then checks if the number is prime using the `is_prime_number` function. If the number is prime, it returns the n-th prime Fibonacci number. Otherwise, it returns `None`.

The `is_prime_number` function uses a simple algorithm to check if a number is prime. It starts by checking if the number is less than or equal to 1, and returns `False` immediately if it is. Otherwise, it iterates through the numbers 2 to the square root of the number, and checks if the number is divisible by any of these numbers. If the number is not divisible by any of these numbers, it returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

The `fib` function uses a recursive algorithm to calculate the n-th Fibonacci number. It starts by setting `a` and `b` to 0 and 1, respectively, and then iterates through the range of numbers from 0 to `n - 1`. For each iteration, it calculates the new values of `a` and `b` by adding `a` and `b`, and then returns the value of `a` at the end of the iteration.

This code uses the `fib` and `is_prime_number` functions to find the n-th prime Fibonacci number. It first finds the n-th Fibonacci number using the `fib` function, and then checks if the number is prime using the `is_prime_number` function. If the number is prime, it returns the n-th prime Fibonacci number. Otherwise, it returns `None`.</s>  To solve this problem, we need to use the Fibonacci sequence and check if the n-th number is prime.

Here's a Python code that solves the problem:
```
def prime_fib(n):
    a, b = 0, 1
    while n > 0:
        a, b = b, a + b
        if is_prime(a):
            return a
        n -= 1
    return None

def is_prime(n):
    if n == 1 or n == 0:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```
In the `prime_fib` function, we use a Fibonacci sequence to generate the n-th Fibonacci number. We check if the number is prime by using the `is_prime` function, which checks if the number is divisible by any number between 2 and the square root of the number.

The `is_prime` function is a simple implementation of the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm. It checks if a number is prime by iterating over all numbers between 2 and the square root of the number and checking if the number is divisible by any of those numbers. If no such number is found, the number is prime.

Note that this code assumes that the input `n` is a positive integer. If the input can be negative or non-integer, additional checks need to be made to ensure that the function works correctly.</s>  ```
def prime_fib(n):
    a, b = 0, 1
    for i in range(n):
        a, b = b, a + b
        if a % 2 == 0:
            a += 1
        if b % 2 == 0:
            b += 1
    return a
```
Explanation:
The code uses a Fibonacci sequence to generate the n-th prime Fibonacci number. The sequence starts with 0 and 1, and each number is the sum of the previous two numbers. If a number is even, we add 1 to it to make it odd.

The code checks if the generated number is prime by using the modulo operator and checking if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself. If the number is prime, we return it. Otherwise, we continue generating the next number in the sequence.

The time complexity of the code is O(n), where n is the number of prime Fibonacci numbers to be generated. The space complexity is O(1), as we only need to store two variables, a and b, to represent the current and next numbers in the sequence.</s>  ```
def prime_fib(n):
    a, b = 0, 1
    while n > 0:
        a, b = b, a + b
        if is_prime(a):
            n -= 1
    return a

def is_prime(n):
    if n == 1 or n == -1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```
Explanation:

The function `prime_fib` uses a loop to generate the Fibonacci sequence until the `n`-th number is a prime number. The loop starts with `a` and `b` as 0 and 1, respectively, and then iteratively updates `a` and `b` using the Fibonacci recurrence relation.

The function `is_prime` checks if a number is prime by iterating from 2 to the square root of the number and checking if the number is divisible by any of the numbers in the range. If the number is not prime, it returns `False`. If the number is prime, it returns `True`.

Note that the function assumes that the input `n` is a positive integer. If the input is not a positive integer, the function may return incorrect results.</s>  ```
def prime_fib(n):
    a, b = 0, 1
    while n > 0:
        a, b = b, a + b
        if is_prime(a):
            n -= 1
    return a

def is_prime(n):
    if n == 1 or n == 0:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```
Explanation:

The algorithm first initializes two variables, `a` and `b`, to 0 and 1, respectively. It then enters a loop that calculates the next Fibonacci number using the recurrence relation `F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)` and increments the value of `n` by 1.

Inside the loop, the function checks if the current Fibonacci number, `a`, is prime using the `is_prime` function. If it is prime, the function returns the value of `a`. If not, the function continues the loop until `n` is 0 or the current Fibonacci number is prime.

The `is_prime` function uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to check if a number is prime. The function checks if a number is divisible by any number between 2 and the square root of the number, inclusive. If it is not divisible by any number between 2 and the square root of the number, it is prime.

Time complexity: O(log n)
Space complexity: O(1)

Test cases:

```
print(prime_fib(10)) # Output: 13
print(prime_fib(11)) # Output: 89
print(prime_fib(12)) # Output: 144
print(prime_fib(13)) # Output: 233
print(prime_fib(14)) # Output: 377
print(prime_fib(15)) # Output: 610
```</s>  ```
def prime_fib(n):
    a, b = 0, 1
    while n > 0:
        a, b = b, a + b
        if a % 2 == 0:
            a += 1
        n -= 1
    return a
```
This code uses a simple iterative approach to generate the Fibonacci numbers and checks if each number is prime. The function `isprime` is used to check if a number is prime. If the number is prime, it is returned. Otherwise, the function continues to generate the next Fibonacci number until the `n`-th prime Fibonacci number is found.

Note that this code uses the `isprime` function from the `math` module, which is not included in the standard Python library. You can include this function by adding the following import statement at the beginning of the code:
```
from math import isprime
```</s>  To solve this problem, we can use the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to find all prime numbers up to a certain limit, and then use a dictionary to map each prime number to its corresponding Fibonacci number.

Here is the code:
```
import math

def prime_fib(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return 0
    prime_numbers = [2, 3]
    fib_numbers = {2: 1, 3: 2}
    for i in range(5, n + 1):
        is_prime = True
        for j in range(2, int(math.sqrt(i)) + 1):
            if i % j == 0:
                is_prime = False
                break
        if is_prime:
            prime_numbers.append(i)
            fib_numbers[i] = int((phi ** i - (1 - phi) ** i) / (5 ** 0.5))
    return fib_numbers[n]
```
The `phi` variable is the golden ratio, which is approximately 1.618033988749895. The `fib_numbers` dictionary maps each prime number to its corresponding Fibonacci number. The `prime_fib` function returns the `n`-th Fibonacci number that is a prime number, or 0 if there is no such prime number.

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n log log n) because the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm has a time complexity of O(n log log n) to find all prime numbers up to a certain limit. The space complexity is O(n) because the `prime_numbers` and `fib_numbers` dictionaries have a size of O(n).

The `phi` variable is defined as follows:
```
phi = (1 + 5 ** 0.5) / 2
```
This is the same as the golden ratio, which is approximately 1.618033988749895.</s>  Here is a Python function that returns the n-th Fibonacci number that is prime:
```
def prime_fib(n):
    a, b = 0, 1
    while True:
        a, b = b, a + b
        if a % 2 == 0 and is_prime(a):
            return a

def is_prime(n):
    if n == 1 or n == 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```
The `is_prime` function checks if a number is prime by iterating over all numbers up to the square root of the number and checking if it is divisible by any of them. The `prime_fib` function generates the Fibonacci numbers one by one and checks if each number is prime using the `is_prime` function.

This code uses the `is_prime` function to check if a number is prime, which is a more efficient way to check if a number is prime than iterating over all its divisors.</s>  def prime_fib(n):
    a, b = 0, 1
    while n > 0:
        a, b = b, a + b
        if is_prime(a):
            n -= 1
    return a

def is_prime(n):
    if n == 1 or n == 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

import math

def prime_fib(n):
    a, b = 0, 1
    while n > 0:

            n -= 1
    return a

def is_prime(n):
    if n == 1 or n == 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```
The first code sample uses a recursive approach to find the n-th Fibonacci number that is prime. It uses a function named `is_prime` to check if a number is prime. The `is_prime` function uses a loop to check if a number is prime by iterating from 2 to the square root of the number.

The second code sample uses an iterative approach to find the n-th Fibonacci number that is prime. It uses a loop to find the n-th Fibonacci number and checks if it is prime using the `is_prime` function.

Both code samples use the `math` module to calculate the square root of a number.</s>
