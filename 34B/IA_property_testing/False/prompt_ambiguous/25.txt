Prompt: Return prime factorization of a given integer.
-------------------
  Sure! Here's a test suite for a future solution to the problem of returning the prime factorization of a given integer:
```
from hypothesis import given, strategies

def property_test(candidate_function):
    @given(strategies.integers())
    def test_prime_factorization(n):
        factors = candidate_function(n)
        assert len(factors) > 0
        assert all(isinstance(factor, int) for factor in factors)
        assert all(factor > 1 for factor in factors)
        assert all(factor == 1 or n % factor == 0 for factor in factors)

    @given(strategies.integers())
    def test_unique_factors(n):
        factors = candidate_function(n)
        assert len(set(factors)) == len(factors)

    return [test_prime_factorization, test_unique_factors]
```
This test suite includes two property tests:

1. `test_prime_factorization`: This test checks that the candidate function returns a list of prime factors for the input integer `n`. It checks that the list is not empty, that each factor is an integer, that each factor is greater than 1, and that each factor divides `n` without leaving a remainder.
2. `test_unique_factors`: This test checks that the candidate function returns a list of unique prime factors for the input integer `n`. It checks that the length of the list is equal to the length of the set of factors, which ensures that all factors are unique.

These tests cover a range of inputs and can help ensure that the candidate function is correct for a wide range of cases.</s>  ```
def prime_factorization(n):
    if n == 1:
        return [1]
    factors = []
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            factors.append(i)
            factors.extend(prime_factorization(n // i))
            break
    else:
        factors.append(n)
    return factors
```
This function uses a simple trial division algorithm to find the prime factors of a given integer `n`. It iterates from 2 to the square root of `n`, and for each iteration, it checks if `n` is divisible by `i`. If it is, it adds `i` to the list of factors and recursively calls the function with `n // i` to find the remaining factors. If no factor is found, the function returns a list containing only `n`.

Here's an explanation of how the code works:

1. The function starts by checking if `n` is equal to 1. If it is, the function returns the list `[1]`, which represents the prime factorization of 1.
2. The function then initializes an empty list `factors` to store the prime factors of `n`.
3. The function then iterates from 2 to the square root of `n`, which is `int(n ** 0.5) + 1`. This is the maximum possible value that a factor can take, since any number greater than the square root of `n` cannot be a factor.
4. For each iteration, the function checks if `n` is divisible by `i` using the modulo operator `%`. If `n` is divisible by `i`, the function adds `i` to the list of factors and recursively calls the function with `n // i` to find the remaining factors.
5. If no factor is found, the function returns the list of factors.

Here's an example of how the function would work for `n = 12`:

1. The function starts by checking if `n` is equal to 1. It is not, so the function proceeds to the next step.
2. The function iterates from 2 to the square root of 12, which is 3.
3. The function checks if 12 is divisible by 2. It is not, so the function moves on to the next iteration.
4. The function checks if 12 is divisible by 3. It is, so the function adds 3 to the list of factors and recursively calls the function with `n // 3`, which is 4.
5. The function checks if 4 is divisible by 2. It is, so the function adds 2 to the list of factors and recursively calls the function with `n // 2`, which is 2.
6. The function checks if 2 is divisible by 2. It is, so the function adds 2 to the list of factors and returns the list `[3, 2, 2]`.

The final result is the prime factorization of 12, which is `[3, 2, 2]`.</s>  ```

This code uses a simple trial division algorithm to find the prime factors of a given integer. It first checks if the input number is 1, and if so, returns [1]. Otherwise, it iterates from 2 to the square root of the input number, and for each iteration, it checks if the input number is divisible by the current iteration number. If it is, it adds the current iteration number to a list of factors and recursively calls the function with the input number divided by the current iteration number. If the input number is not divisible by the current iteration number, it adds the input number to the list of factors and breaks out of the loop. Finally, it returns the list of factors.

Here's an explanation of the code:

1. The function takes an integer `n` as input.
2. It checks if `n` is equal to 1, and if so, returns a list containing only 1.
3. It initializes an empty list `factors` to store the prime factors of `n`.
4. It iterates from 2 to the square root of `n`, inclusive, using the `range` function.
5. For each iteration, it checks if `n` is divisible by the current iteration number using the modulo operator (`%`).
6. If `n` is divisible by the current iteration number, it adds the current iteration number to the `factors` list and recursively calls the function with the input number divided by the current iteration number.
7. If `n` is not divisible by the current iteration number, it adds `n` to the `factors` list and breaks out of the loop using the `break` statement.
8. It returns the `factors` list.

Here's an example of how to use the function:
```
print(prime_factorization(12)) # Output: [2, 2, 3]
print(prime_factorization(15)) # Output: [3, 5]
print(prime_factorization(24)) # Output: [2, 2, 2, 3]

This function takes an integer `n` as input and returns a list of prime factors of `n`. The function uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to find the prime factors of `n`. The function first checks if `n` is even and if it is, it appends 2 to the list of factors and divides `n` by 2. Then, it iterates from 3 to the square root of `n` in steps of 2 and checks if `n` is divisible by any of these numbers. If it is, it appends the factor to the list of factors and divides `n` by the factor. Finally, if `n` is greater than 2, it appends `n` to the list of factors.

Here is an example usage of the function:
```
print(prime_factorization(12)) # Output: [2, 2, 3]
print(prime_factorization(15)) # Output: [3, 5]
print(prime_factorization(24)) # Output: [2, 2, 2, 3]
