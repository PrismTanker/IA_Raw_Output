Prompt: It is the last week of the semester and the teacher has to give the grades
    to students. The teacher has been making her own algorithm for grading.
    The only problem is, she has lost the code she used for grading.
    She has given you a list of GPAs for some students and you have to write 
    a function that can output a list of letter grades using the following table:
             GPA       |    Letter grade
              4.0                A+
            > 3.7                A 
            > 3.3                A- 
            > 3.0                B+
            > 2.7                B 
            > 2.3                B-
            > 2.0                C+
            > 1.7                C
            > 1.3                C-
            > 1.0                D+ 
            > 0.7                D 
            > 0.0                D-
              0.0                E
    

    Example:
    grade_equation([4.0, 3, 1.7, 2, 3.5]) ==> ['A+', 'B', 'C-', 'C', 'A-']

**********************

  Sure! Here are some additional property tests that can be added to the test suite to increase coverage:

1. Test that the function returns the correct letter grade for a range of GPA values:
```
@given(strategies.floats(min_value=0.0, max_value=4.0))
def test_gpa_range_2(candidate_function, gpa):
    letter_grade = candidate_function(gpa)
    assert letter_grade in ["A+", "A", "A-", "B+", "B", "B-", "C+", "C", "C-", "D+", "D", "D-", "E"]
    if gpa >= 3.7:
        assert letter_grade == "A"
    elif gpa >= 3.3:
        assert letter_grade == "A-"
    elif gpa >= 3.0:
        assert letter_grade == "B+"
    elif gpa >= 2.7:
        assert letter_grade == "B"
    elif gpa >= 2.3:
        assert letter_grade == "B-"
    elif gpa >= 2.0:
        assert letter_grade == "C+"
    elif gpa >= 1.7:
        assert letter_grade == "C"
    elif gpa >= 1.3:
        assert letter_grade == "C-"
    elif gpa >= 1.0:
        assert letter_grade == "D+"
    elif gpa >= 0.7:
        assert letter_grade == "D"
    elif gpa >= 0.0:
        assert letter_grade == "D-"
    else:
        assert letter_grade == "E"
```
2. Test that the function raises an exception for GPA values that are not within the range of 0.0 to 4.0:
```
@given(strategies.floats(min_value=-1.0, max_value=5.0))
def test_invalid_gpa(candidate_function, gpa):
    with pytest.raises(ValueError):
        candidate_function(gpa)
```
3. Test that the function returns the correct letter grade for a list of GPA values:
```
@given(strategies.lists(strategies.floats(min_value=0.0, max_value=4.0), min_size=1, max_size=10))
def test_gpa_list(candidate_function, gpa_list):
    letter_grade_list = candidate_function(gpa_list)
    assert len(letter_grade_list) == len(gpa_list)
    for gpa, letter_grade in zip(gpa_list, letter_grade_list):
        assert letter_grade in ["A+", "A", "A-", "B+", "B", "B-", "C+", "C", "C-", "D+", "D", "D-", "E"]

These tests cover additional cases that were not included in the original test suite, such as testing the function with a list of GPA values, testing the function with invalid GPA values, and testing the function with a range of GPA values.</s>  Sure, I can help you extend the coverage of the test suite. Here's an example of two additional property tests that you could add:

@given(strategies.floats(min_value=-1.0, max_value=4.0))
def test_gpa_range_with_negative_values(candidate_function, gpa):
    letter_grade = candidate_function(gpa)
    assert letter_grade in ["A+", "A", "A-", "B+", "B", "B-", "C+", "C", "C-", "D+", "D", "D-", "E"]
    if gpa < 0.0:
        assert letter_grade == "E"

@given(strategies.floats(min_value=0.0, max_value=4.0))
def test_gpa_range_with_decimal_values(candidate_function, gpa):
    letter_grade = candidate_function(gpa)
    assert letter_grade in ["A+", "A", "A-", "B+", "B", "B-", "C+", "C", "C-", "D+", "D", "D-", "E"]
    if gpa == 3.3:
        assert letter_grade == "A-"
    elif gpa == 2.7:
        assert letter_grade == "B-"
    elif gpa == 2.3:
        assert letter_grade == "C-"
    elif gpa == 1.7:
        assert letter_grade == "C+"
    elif gpa == 1.3:
        assert letter_grade == "D-"
    elif gpa == 0.7:
        assert letter_grade == "D+"
    elif gpa == 0.0:
        assert letter_grade == "E"

These additional tests cover the following cases:

* Testing the function with negative GPA values (e.g., -1.0, -0.5) to ensure that the function returns the correct letter grade for such values.
* Testing the function with decimal GPA values (e.g., 3.3, 2.7, 2.3, 1.7, 1.3, 0.7, 0.0) to ensure that the function returns the correct letter grade for such values.

Note that these additional tests are not exhaustive and you may need to add more tests depending on the specific requirements of your problem.</s>  Here's an example of how you could extend the test suite with more property tests:

The code above satisfies the property tests provided by the `property_test` function. It uses a series of `if-elif` statements to determine the letter grade for each GPA in the input list, and appends the corresponding letter grade to a new list. The `property_test` function is then used to test the `grade_equation` function with a range of input GPAs to ensure that it produces the expected letter grades.</s>  Sure, I can help you with that! Here's a possible solution that satisfies the property tests:
```

This function takes a GPA as input and returns the corresponding letter grade based on the table provided. The function uses a series of `if-elif` statements to check the GPA and return the appropriate letter grade.

To test the function, you can use the `property_test` function provided in the problem statement. Here's an example usage:
```
from hypothesis import given, strategies

This function takes a single GPA as input and returns the corresponding letter grade based on the given table. The function uses a series of `if` statements to check the GPA and return the corresponding letter grade.

To test this function, you can use the `property_test` function provided in the problem statement. Here's an example of how to use it:
```
property_test(grade_equation)
```
This will run the `property_test` function on the `grade_equation` function and print the results. If the function passes all the tests, it will print "All tests passed.". If it fails any of the tests, it will print the name of the test that failed and the expected and actual values.</s>  ```

This code satisfies the property tests provided by the `property_test` function. It takes a single GPA as input and returns the corresponding letter grade according to the table provided in the problem statement. If the GPA is not valid (i.e., not between 0.0 and 4.0), it returns an error.

The code also satisfies the additional test cases provided by the `test_gpa_range` and `test_gpa_list` functions. The `test_gpa_range` function checks that the function returns the correct letter grade for a given GPA in the range of 0.0 to 4.0. The `test_gpa_list` function checks that the function returns the correct letter grade for a list of GPAs.</s>  Here is a possible solution:
```

This function takes a single GPA as input and returns the corresponding letter grade according to the given table. The function uses a series of if-elif statements to check the GPA against the different grade thresholds and returns the corresponding letter grade.

To test this function, you can use the `property_test` function provided in the problem statement. The `property_test` function takes a function (in this case, the `grade_equation` function) as input and tests it against a range of GPA values using the given table. The function returns a list of letter grades corresponding to the input GPA values.

For example, to test the `grade_equation` function with the GPA values [4.0, 3, 1.7, 2, 3.5], you can use the following code:
```
property_test(grade_equation, [4.0, 3, 1.7, 2, 3.5])
```
This will output a list of letter grades corresponding to the input GPA values:
```
['A+', 'B', 'C-', 'C', 'A-']
```</s>  ```

```
Note: The code is wrapped in a function called `grade_equation` that takes a list of GPAs as input and returns a list of letter grades. The function uses a series of if-else statements to determine the letter grade for each GPA. The letter grades are stored in a list and returned at the end of the function.</s>
