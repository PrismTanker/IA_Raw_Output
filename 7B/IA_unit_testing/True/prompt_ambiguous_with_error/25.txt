-------------------
  Here is a test suite to test a future solution to the problem:
```
{
    "prime_factors_of_12": {
        "in": {
            "n": 12
        },

    },
    "prime_factors_of_30": {
        "in": {
            "n": 30
        },
        "out": [2, 3, 5]
    },
    "prime_factors_of_15": {
        "in": {
            "n": 15
        },
        "out": [3, 5]
    },
    "prime_factors_of_48": {
        "in": {
            "n": 48
        },

    },
    "prime_factors_of_100": {
        "in": {
            "n": 100
        },
        "out": [2, 2, 5, 5]
    },
    "prime_factors_of_24": {
        "in": {

```
This test suite includes six tests, each of which tests a different input value for the `n` parameter. The `in` object contains the input parameter values, and the `out` object contains the expected output values. The test suite ensures that the solution returns the correct prime factors for each input value.</s>  To find the prime factors of a given integer, you can use the following code:
```
def prime_factors(n):
    factors = []
    i = 2
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i:
            i += 1
        else:
            n //= i
            factors.append(i)
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)
    return factors
```
This code uses a simple loop to iterate over the possible prime factors of the integer. It checks if the number is divisible by each prime factor, and if it is, it divides the number by that factor and adds it to the list of factors. Once the number is no longer divisible by any of the prime factors, it is added to the list of factors.

For example, if you call the function with the argument `n = 12`, it will return the list `[2, 2, 3]`.

Note that this function assumes that the input is a positive integer. If you want to handle negative integers, you will need to modify the function accordingly.</s>  ```
def prime_factors(n):
    factors = []
    i = 2
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i:
            i += 1
        else:
            n //= i
            factors.append(i)
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)
    return factors
```
Explanation:

The above code uses a simple algorithm to find the prime factors of a given integer. It starts with the smallest prime number (2) and checks if it divides the given integer. If it does, it divides the integer by the prime number and appends it to the list of factors. It then increments the prime number and continues this process until the integer is fully factored.

The `factors` list contains all the prime factors of the given integer in the order they were found.

For example, if the input is `n = 12`, the output would be `[2, 2, 3]`.</s>  Here's a Python function that returns the prime factors of a given integer:
```
def prime_factors(n):
    factors = []
    while n % 2 == 0:
        factors.append(2)
        n //= 2
    for i in range(3, int(n ** 0.5) + 1, 2):
        while n % i == 0:
            factors.append(i)
            n //= i
    if n > 2:
        factors.append(n)
    return factors
```
This function uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to find all prime factors of the input integer `n`. It starts by dividing `n` by 2 and adding 2 to the list of prime factors if `n` is even. Then it iterates over the range of odd numbers up to the square root of `n`, and adds each factor of `n` to the list of prime factors if it divides `n`. Finally, if `n` is not a perfect square, it adds `n` to the list of prime factors.

Here are some test cases for this function:
```
print(prime_factors(12))  # [2, 2, 3]
print(prime_factors(15))  # [3, 5]
print(prime_factors(100))  # [2, 2, 5, 5]
print(prime_factors(1000000))  # [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 11, 11, 11, 11, 11, 11, 13, 13, 13, 13, 13, 17, 17, 17, 17, 17, 17, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 23, 23, 23, 23, 23, 23, 29, 29, 29, 29, 29, 29, 31, 31, 31, 31, 31, 31, 31, 37, 37, 37, 37, 37, 37, 37, 41, 41, 41, 41, 41, 41, 41, 43, 43, 43, 43, 43, 43, 43, 47, 47, 47, 47, 47, 47, 47, 53, 53, 53, 53, 53, 53, 53, 59, 59, 59, 59, 59, 59, 59]
```</s>  ```
def prime_factors(n):
    factors = []
    i = 2
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i:
            i += 1
        else:
            n //= i
            factors.append(i)
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)
    return factors
```</s>  To find the prime factors of a given integer, we can use the following code:
```
def prime_factors(n):
    factors = []
    i = 2
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i:
            i += 1
        else:
            n //= i
            factors.append(i)
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)
    return factors
```
This code uses a simple loop to check if the given number is divisible by any prime factors. If it is not divisible, it increments the variable `i` by 1 and tries again. If it is divisible, it divides the number by the prime factor and adds it to the list of factors. Finally, it returns the list of prime factors.

Note that this code assumes that the input number is positive and non-zero. If the input is negative or zero, it will return an empty list. You can modify the code to handle these cases as needed.</s>  To find the prime factors of a given integer, we can use the following function:
```
def prime_factors(n):
    factors = []
    while n % 2 == 0:
        factors.append(2)
        n //= 2
    for i in range(3, int(n ** 0.5) + 1, 2):
        while n % i == 0:
            factors.append(i)
            n //= i
    if n > 2:
        factors.append(n)
    return factors
```
This function works by first checking if the input number is even and adding 2 to the list of prime factors if it is. Then, it checks if the input number is odd and iterates over the range of odd numbers from 3 to the square root of the input number, adding each prime factor to the list of factors if it divides the input number. Finally, if the input number is not prime, it is added to the list of prime factors.

For example, if we call the function with the input 12, it will return the list [2, 2, 3]. If we call the function with the input 100, it will return the list [2, 2, 5, 5].

Note that this function assumes that the input number is positive. If the input number is negative, it will return the prime factors of the absolute value of the input number. For example, if we call the function with the input -12, it will return the list [2, 2, -3].</s>  ```
def prime_factors(n):
    factors = []
    i = 2
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i:
            i += 1
        else:
            n //= i
            factors.append(i)
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)
    return factors
```
This code uses a simple loop to iterate over the factors of the input number `n`. The loop starts with `i` initialized to 2, the smallest prime number, and continues until `i` is greater than or equal to the square root of `n`. If `n` is divisible by `i`, the loop continues with `i` incremented by 1 and the loop starts again. If `n` is not divisible by `i`, the loop breaks and `i` is added to the list of prime factors. The final result is returned as a list of prime factors.

The `factors` list is initialized with an empty list and the `i` variable is used to keep track of the current prime factor. The loop continues until all prime factors of `n` have been found and the final list of prime factors is returned.

Note that this code assumes that the input number `n` is a positive integer. If `n` is a negative integer, the code will return the prime factors of its absolute value. If `n` is 0 or a floating-point number, the code will return an empty list.</s>  Here is a Python function that returns the prime factors of a given integer:

            i += 1
        else:
            n //= i
            factors.append(i)
    if n > 1:

    return factors
```
This function uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to find all prime factors of the given integer. It starts by iterating from 2 to the square root of the input number, and for each number it checks if it is a factor of the input number. If it is a factor, it divides the input number by that factor and adds it to the list of prime factors. If it is not a factor, it increments the number by 1 and continues the loop. Finally, if the input number is greater than 1, it adds the remaining number to the list of prime factors.

For example, if we call the function with the input 120, it will return the list `[2, 2, 3, 5]`.</s>  Here's a Python code that returns the prime factors of a given integer:
```
def prime_factors(n):
    factors = []
    while n % 2 == 0:
        factors.append(2)
        n //= 2
    for i in range(3, int(n ** 0.5) + 1, 2):
        while n % i == 0:
            factors.append(i)
            n //= i
    if n > 2:
        factors.append(n)
    return factors
```
This code uses a combination of trial division and the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to find the prime factors of a given integer. It first checks if the number is even, and if it is, it adds 2 to the list of prime factors and divides the number by 2. Then it checks if the number is odd and if it is, it iterates from 3 to the square root of the number, adding any prime factors it finds to the list of prime factors. Finally, if the number is still greater than 2, it adds it to the list of prime factors.

This function uses a simple loop to iterate over the possible prime factors of the given number `n`. It starts by initializing an empty list `factors` to store the prime factors. Then, it iterates over the range of possible prime factors starting from `2` and checks if `n` is divisible by the current prime factor `i`. If `n` is not divisible, the loop increments the current prime factor `i` and continues checking. If `n` is divisible, the loop divides `n` by the current prime factor `i` and appends the result to the `factors` list. Finally, if `n` is a prime number greater than `1`, it is appended to the `factors` list.

Note that this function assumes that the input `n` is a positive integer. If the input is a negative integer, the function will return an empty list.</s>
