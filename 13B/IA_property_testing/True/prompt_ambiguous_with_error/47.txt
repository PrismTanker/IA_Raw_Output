import statistics

def get_mean(numbers):
    return statistics.mean(numbers)
```
This function calculates the mean of a list of numbers using the `statistics` module from Python's standard library. The `mean` function from the `statistics` module returns the mean of a list of numbers.

Here is an example of how to use this function:
```
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(get_mean(numbers))  # Output: 3.0
```
This code calculates the mean of the list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and prints the result, which is 3.0.</s>  ```
import statistics

def calculate_mean(numbers):
    return statistics.mean(numbers)
```
This function takes a list of numbers as an argument and uses the `statistics` module to calculate the mean of the numbers. The `mean` function returns the mean of the numbers in the list.

Here are some test cases to demonstrate how the function works:
```
print(calculate_mean([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))  # Output: 3.0
print(calculate_mean([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]))  # Output: 3.5
print(calculate_mean([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]))  # Output: 4.0
```
Note that the function only requires the `statistics` module, which is a built-in module in Python. Therefore, you don't need to install any additional packages to use this function.</s>  ```
import statistics

def get_mean(numbers):
    return statistics.mean(numbers)
```

This function takes in a list of numbers and returns the mean of the list using the `statistics.mean()` function from the `statistics` module.

Here is an example of how to use the function:
```
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(get_mean(numbers))  # Output: 3.0
```</s>  ```
def mean(numbers):
    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)
```
This code defines a function named `mean` that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the mean of the numbers. The function uses the `sum` function to calculate the sum of the numbers and the `len` function to calculate the length of the list. The mean is then calculated by dividing the sum by the length of the list. The `mean` function is then called with the list of numbers as an argument and the result is returned.

Here is an example of how the `mean` function can be used:
```
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(mean(numbers)) # prints 3.0
```
This code calls the `mean` function with a list of numbers and prints the result, which is 3.0.

Note: The `mean` function assumes that the input list is not empty. If the input list is empty, the function will raise an error. It is the responsibility of the caller to ensure that the input list is not empty before calling the `mean` function.

Also, the `mean` function uses the `sum` and `len` functions, which are built-in functions in Python.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or if you need further clarification.</s>  ```
def mean(numbers):
    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)
```
This function takes a list of numbers as an input and returns the mean of the list. The function first calculates the sum of the numbers using the `sum()` function, and then divides the sum by the length of the list using the `len()` function.

Here is an example of how you can use this function:
```
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(mean(numbers))  # Output: 3.0
```
This code will calculate the mean of the list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and print the result, which is `3.0`.

Note that this function assumes that the input list is not empty. If the list is empty, the function will raise a `ZeroDivisionError` exception. You may want to add a check to handle this case if you plan to use the function with empty lists.</s>  ```
def get_mean(numbers):
    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)
```
This function takes a list of numbers as input and returns the mean of the list. It uses the built-in `sum` function to calculate the sum of the list and the `len` function to get the length of the list. The mean is calculated by dividing the sum by the length of the list.

Here are some test cases to demonstrate the function's behavior:
```
print(get_mean([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))  # Output: 3.0
print(get_mean([10, 20, 30, 40, 50]))  # Output: 30.0
print(get_mean([100, 200, 300, 400, 500]))  # Output: 300.0
```
Note that the function only works for lists of numbers and will raise an error if the input is not a list.</s>  ```
import statistics

def get_mean(my_list):
    return statistics.mean(my_list)
```
This code uses the `statistics` module to calculate the mean of a list of numbers. The `statistics.mean()` function takes a list of numbers as its argument and returns the mean.

You can test this function with the following code:
```
print(get_mean([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))  # Output: 3.0
print(get_mean([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]))  # Output: 3.5
print(get_mean([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]))  # Output: 4.0
```
Note that the `get_mean()` function takes a list of numbers as its argument, and it returns the mean of that list. You can use this function to calculate the mean of any list of numbers.</s>  ```
import statistics

def get_mean(numbers):
    return statistics.mean(numbers)
```
This code uses the `statistics` module to calculate the mean of a list of numbers. The `mean` function is used to calculate the mean, and the input list is passed as an argument. The function returns the mean value.

Here is an example of how the function can be used:
```
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
mean = get_mean(numbers)
print(mean)  # Output: 3.0
```
This code defines a list of numbers and passes it to the `get_mean` function. The function calculates the mean of the list and returns the value, which is then printed to the console.</s>  ```
import statistics

def mean(numbers):
    return statistics.mean(numbers)
```</s>  ```
import statistics

def get_mean(numbers):
    return statistics.mean(numbers)
```
This code uses the `statistics` module to calculate the mean of a list of numbers. The `mean` function takes a list of numbers as an argument and returns the mean. The function is defined using the `def` keyword, and the function name is `get_mean`. The function body contains a single line of code that calls the `mean` function from the `statistics` module with the `numbers` list as an argument. The `return` keyword is used to return the result of the `mean` function.

Test cases:
```
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(get_mean(numbers))  # Should print 3.0

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
print(get_mean(numbers))  # Should print 3.5

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
print(get_mean(numbers))  # Should print 4.0
```
The test cases check that the function returns the correct mean value for various lists of numbers. The test cases use the `print` function to display the result of the `get_mean` function with different lists of numbers.</s>

This function takes in a list of numbers and returns the mean of the list. It uses the `statistics` module to calculate the mean.

Here's an example of how you can use the function:
```
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
mean = get_mean(numbers)
print(mean) # Output: 3.0
```
This code will calculate the mean of the list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and print the result, which is `3.0`.</s>  ```
def get_mean(numbers):
    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)
```
This function takes a list of numbers as an argument and returns the mean of those numbers. It uses the `sum` function to calculate the sum of the numbers and the `len` function to calculate the length of the list. The `return` statement is used to return the mean of the numbers.

Here is an example of how the function can be used:
```
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(get_mean(numbers))  # Output: 3.0
```
This code passes the test case because it returns the mean of the numbers in the list, which is 3.0.</s>  ```
def get_mean(numbers):
    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)
```
This function takes a list of numbers as input and returns the mean of the list. The function uses the built-in `sum()` function to calculate the sum of the list and the `len()` function to get the length of the list. The mean is then calculated by dividing the sum by the length of the list.

Here is an example of how you can use this function:
```
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
mean = get_mean(numbers)
print(mean)
```
This code will output `3.0`, which is the mean of the list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.

Note that this function assumes that the input list is not empty. If the list is empty, the function will raise a `ZeroDivisionError` exception. To avoid this, you can add a check for an empty list before calculating the mean:
```
def get_mean(numbers):
    if len(numbers) == 0:
        return None
    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)
```
This modified function will return `None` if the input list is empty.</s>  ```
def mean(numbers):
    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)
```
This function takes a list of numbers as input and returns the mean of the list. The `sum` function is used to calculate the sum of the numbers, and the `len` function is used to get the length of the list. The division is done to get the mean.

import statistics

def get_mean(numbers):
    return statistics.mean(numbers)
```
This function takes a list of numbers as input and returns the mean of the list using the `statistics.mean()` function from the `statistics` module. The `mean()` function calculates the average of a list of numbers, and it is more accurate than the `sum()` function in case of large lists.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
mean = get_mean(numbers)
print(mean)  # Output: 3.0
```</s>  ```
import statistics

def get_mean(numbers):
    return statistics.mean(numbers)
```

This code uses the `statistics` module to calculate the mean of a list of numbers. The `statistics.mean()` function takes a list of numbers as input and returns the mean of the list.

Here's an example of how to use this function:

    return statistics.mean(my_list)
```
This code uses the `statistics` module to calculate the mean of a list. It takes a list as input and returns the mean as a float.

Here is an example usage of the function:
```
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(mean(my_list))  # Output: 3.0
```
This code will print the mean of the list `my_list`, which is 3.0.</s>  ```

import statistics

def get_mean(numbers):
    return statistics.mean(numbers)
```
This code uses the `statistics` module to calculate the mean of a list of numbers. The function `get_mean` takes a list of numbers as an argument and returns the mean.

For example, if we call the function with the list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, it will return the mean, which is 3.

Here are a few test cases to demonstrate how the function works:
```
print(get_mean([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))  # Output: 3.0
print(get_mean([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]))  # Output: 3.5
print(get_mean([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]))  # Output: 4.0
print(get_mean([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]))  # Output: 4.5
```
Note that the `statistics` module is only available in Python 3.8 and later versions. If you are using an earlier version of Python, you will need to use a different method to calculate the mean.</s>  ```
def get_mean(numbers):
    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)
```
This function takes a list of numbers as input and returns the mean of the list. It uses the built-in `sum` function to calculate the sum of the numbers, and the `len` function to calculate the length of the list.

Here is an example of how to use the function:
```
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
mean = get_mean(numbers)
print(mean)
```
This will output `3.0`, which is the mean of the list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.

Note that this function assumes that the input list is not empty. If the input list is empty, the function will raise a `ZeroDivisionError`. If you want to handle this case, you can modify the function as follows:
```
def get_mean(numbers):
    if len(numbers) == 0:
        return 0
    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)
```
This function will return `0` if the input list is empty, instead of raising an error.</s>  ```

import statistics

def mean(numbers):
    return statistics.mean(numbers)
```
This code uses the `statistics` module to calculate the mean of a list of numbers. The `mean` function takes a list of numbers as input and returns the mean of the list.

To use this code, you can call the `mean` function with a list of numbers as an argument, like this:
```
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(mean(numbers))
```
This will output `3.0`, which is the mean of the list of numbers.

Note that this code will work with any list of numbers, not just the specific list of numbers in the example.</s>

This test suite uses the `hypothesis` library to generate lists of random floating-point numbers and tests the following properties of the `mean` function:

1. The mean of a list of numbers should be the sum of those numbers divided by the length of the list.
2. The mean of a list of numbers should be greater than or equal to the smallest number in the list.
3. The mean of a list of numbers should be less than or equal to the largest number in the list.

To use this test suite, simply import the `property_test` function and call it with the `mean` function as an argument:
```

This code defines a function `get_mean` that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the mean of those numbers. The `sum` function is used to calculate the sum of the numbers, and the `len` function is used to get the length of the list. The division of the sum by the length gives the mean.

Here's an example usage of the `get_mean` function:
```
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(get_mean(numbers))  # Output: 3.0
```
This code calls the `get_mean` function with the list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` as input, and prints the result, which is `3.0`.</s>  ```
import statistics

def mean(numbers):
    return statistics.mean(numbers)
```
This code uses the `statistics` module to calculate the mean of a list of numbers. The `mean` function takes a list of numbers as an argument and returns the mean of the list.

Here's an example usage of the `mean` function:
```
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(mean(numbers))  # Output: 3.0
```
This code will print `3.0`, which is the mean of the list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.

This code passes the following test cases:
```
import unittest

class TestMean(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_mean(self):
        self.assertEqual(mean([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]), 3.0)
        self.assertEqual(mean([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]), 3.5)
        self.assertEqual(mean([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]), 4.0)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()

import statistics

def mean(numbers):
    return statistics.mean(numbers)
```
This code uses the `statistics` module from the Python standard library to calculate the mean of a list of numbers. The `mean()` function takes a list of numbers as an argument and returns the mean.

Here is an example usage of the `mean()` function:
```
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(mean(numbers)) # Output: 3.0
```
This code will print the mean of the list of numbers `numbers`, which is `3.0`.</s>  ```
def get_mean(numbers):
    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)
```
This function takes a list of numbers as input and returns the mean of the list. It uses the `sum()` function to calculate the sum of the numbers and the `len()` function to calculate the length of the list. The result is then divided by the length of the list to get the mean.

Here is an example of how to use this function:
```
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
mean = get_mean(numbers)
print(mean)
```
This code will print `3.0`, which is the mean of the list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.</s>  ```
import statistics

def get_mean(numbers):
    return statistics.mean(numbers)
```
Here, we use the `statistics` module to calculate the mean of a list of numbers. The `mean` function returns the mean of the input list.

This function can be tested as follows:
```
assert get_mean([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == 3.0
assert get_mean([1, 2, 3, 4]) == 2.5
assert get_mean([1, 2, 3]) == 2.0
```
These test cases check that the function returns the correct mean for different lists of numbers.</s>

def mean(numbers):
    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)
```
This code will calculate the mean of a list of numbers. The `sum` function is used to calculate the sum of the numbers, and the `len` function is used to get the length of the list. The result is then divided by the length of the list to get the mean.

Here is an example of how to use this function:
```
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(mean(numbers))  # Output: 3.0
```
This will print the mean of the list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, which is `3.0`.</s>  ```
import statistics

def get_mean(numbers):
    return statistics.mean(numbers)
```
This code uses the `statistics` module to calculate the mean of a list of numbers. The `statistics.mean()` function takes a list of numbers as an argument and returns the mean.

To use this function, you can call it with a list of numbers as an argument, like this:
```
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
mean = get_mean(numbers)
print(mean)
```
This will output `3.0`, which is the mean of the numbers in the list.

Note that this code assumes that the list of numbers is not empty. If the list is empty, the function will raise a `ValueError`. You can handle this error by checking the length of the list before calling the `get_mean()` function, like this:
```
if len(numbers) == 0:
    raise ValueError("The list is empty")
```
This will raise a `ValueError` if the list is empty, and the code will not attempt to calculate the mean.</s>  ```
def mean(numbers):
    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)
```
This code defines a function `mean` that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the mean of those numbers. The function first computes the sum of the numbers using the `sum` function, and then divides the sum by the length of the list using the `/` operator.

Here's an example usage of the `mean` function:
```
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(mean(numbers))  # Output: 3.0
```
This code passes the test case by printing the mean of the list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`. The expected output is `3.0`, which is the correct mean of the list.

Note that this code assumes that the input list is not empty. If the list is empty, the function will raise a `ZeroDivisionError` exception. To handle this case, you can add a check at the beginning of the function to ensure that the list is not empty:
```
def mean(numbers):
    if not numbers:
        return None
    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)
```
This updated version of the `mean` function returns `None` if the input list is empty. This can be useful in cases where you want to handle the empty list case explicitly.</s>  ```
import statistics

def get_mean(numbers):
    return statistics.mean(numbers)
```

This code uses the `statistics` module to calculate the mean of a list of numbers. The `statistics.mean()` function calculates the mean of a list of numbers, and it returns the result as a float. The `get_mean()` function takes a list of numbers as an argument and returns the mean of the list.

Here's an example of how to use the `get_mean()` function:
```
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(get_mean(numbers))  # Output: 3.0
```
This code calculates the mean of the list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and prints the result, which is `3.0`.

This code passes the following test cases:
```
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
assert get_mean(numbers) == 3.0

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
assert get_mean(numbers) == 3.5

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
assert get_mean(numbers) == 4.0
```
These test cases check that the `get_mean()` function calculates the mean of a list of numbers correctly.</s>  ```
def mean(numbers):
    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)
```
This function takes a list of numbers as input and returns the mean of the numbers. The `sum()` function is used to calculate the sum of the numbers, and the `len()` function is used to calculate the length of the list. The mean is then calculated by dividing the sum by the length of the list.

Here are some test cases:
```
>>> mean([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
3.0
>>> mean([1, 2, 3])
2.0
>>> mean([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])
3.5
>>> mean([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7])
4.0
```
Note that the mean is calculated by dividing the sum of the numbers by the length of the list. In the first example, the sum of the numbers is 15, and the length of the list is 5, so the mean is 15/5 = 3.0. In the second example, the sum of the numbers is 6, and the length of the list is 3, so the mean is 6/3 = 2.0. In the third example, the sum of the numbers is 21, and the length of the list is 6, so the mean is 21/6 = 3.5. In the fourth example, the sum of the numbers is 28, and the length of the list is 7, so the mean is 28/7 = 4.0.</s>  ```
import statistics

This code will calculate the mean of a list of numbers. It takes a list of numbers as an argument and returns the mean as a float.

Here's an example usage:
```
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(get_mean(numbers))  # prints 3.0
```
This code will print the mean of the list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, which is `3.0`.

This code uses the `sum` function from the `math` module to calculate the sum of the list, and the `len` function from the `len` module to get the length of the list. The mean is then calculated by dividing the sum by the length of the list.</s>  ```
import statistics

def get_mean(numbers):
    return statistics.mean(numbers)

This code uses the `statistics` module from the Python Standard Library to calculate the mean of a list of numbers. The `statistics.mean()` function takes a list of numbers as an argument and returns the mean of the list.

Here's an example of how to use this function:
```
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
mean = get_mean(numbers)
print(mean)

This will output `3.0`, which is the mean of the list of numbers.

Please note that this code will work for any list of numbers, and it does not require any additional modules.</s>  ```
import statistics

def mean(numbers):
    return statistics.mean(numbers)
```
This function takes a list of numbers as input and returns the mean of the list using the `statistics.mean()` function from the `statistics` module.

Here are some examples of how the function can be used:
```
>>> mean([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
3.0
>>> mean([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])
3.5
>>> mean([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7])
4.0
```
Note that the `mean()` function returns a floating-point number, so you may need to use the `round()` function to get a rounded value if you want to return an integer.</s>  ```
import statistics

def get_mean(my_list):
    return statistics.mean(my_list)
```

This code uses the `statistics` module to calculate the mean of a list of numbers. The `mean()` function from the `statistics` module takes a list of numbers as an argument and returns the mean of those numbers.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
mean = get_mean(my_list)
print(mean)  # prints 3.0
```
This code calculates the mean of the list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and stores the result in the variable `mean`. The `print()` function is then used to print the value of `mean` to the console.

Note that the `statistics` module is only available in Python 3.8 and later versions. If you are using an earlier version of Python, you can use the following code instead:
```
def get_mean(my_list):
    n = len(my_list)
    sum = 0
    for x in my_list:
        sum += x
    return sum / n
```
This code calculates the mean of a list of numbers by summing the elements of the list and dividing by the number of elements. It works for any version of Python.</s>
