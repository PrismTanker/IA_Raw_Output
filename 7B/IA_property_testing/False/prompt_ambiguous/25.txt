Prompt: Return prime factorization of a given integer.
-------------------
  Sure, here's a test suite for a future solution to the problem of returning the prime factorization of a given integer:
```
from hypothesis import given, strategies

def property_test(candidate_function) -> None:
    @given(strategies.integers())
    def property_1(n):
        factors = candidate_function(n)
        assert all(isinstance(factor, int) for factor in factors)
        assert all(factor > 0 for factor in factors)
        assert all(factor < n for factor in factors)
        assert all(is_prime(factor) for factor in factors)

    @given(strategies.integers(min_value=2, max_value=10000))
    def property_2(n):
        factors = candidate_function(n)
        assert len(factors) == len(set(factors))

    return [property_1, property_2]
```
This test suite uses the Hypothesis library to generate integers and test the candidate function with them. It also includes two properties:

* Property 1: The candidate function should return a list of integers that are all positive and less than the input integer, and that are all prime numbers.
* Property 2: The candidate function should return a list of unique factors.

Note that the second property assumes that the candidate function is correct, so it should be tested after the first property is verified.</s>  ```
def prime_factorization(n):
    if n == 1:
        return [1]
    
    factors = []
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            factors.append(i)
            n //= i
    
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)
    
    return factors
```
This code uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to find all prime factors of a given integer. It starts by iterating from 2 to the square root of the input number and checking if the number is divisible by each number in the range. If it is divisible, it divides the number and continues the loop. If it is not divisible, it moves on to the next number in the range. The loop continues until all prime factors of the input number have been found. The final list of prime factors is returned.</s>  ```
def prime_factorization(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return []
    factors = []
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        while n % i == 0:
            factors.append(i)
            n //= i
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)
    return factors
```
Explanation:

The function first checks if the input number is less than or equal to 1. If it is, it returns an empty list.

The function then iterates through the numbers from 2 to the square root of the input number, checking if the input number is divisible by each number. If it is, the function adds that number to the list of factors and divides the input number by it.

Finally, if the input number is not 1, it is added to the list of factors and returned.

This function uses the modulo operator (%) and the integer division operator (//) to perform the calculations.

It also uses the range() function to generate a range of numbers from 2 to the square root of the input number.</s>  Here is a Python code that returns the prime factorization of a given integer:
```
def prime_factorization(n):
    factors = []
    while n % 2 == 0:
        factors.append(2)
        n //= 2
    for i in range(3, int(n ** 0.5) + 1, 2):
        while n % i == 0:
            factors.append(i)
            n //= i
    if n > 2:
        factors.append(n)
    return factors
```
This code uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to find all prime factors of a given integer. The Sieve of Eratosthenes is an efficient algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to a certain limit. It works by iteratively marking as composite (not prime) any number divisible by a prime number less than or equal to the square root of the limit. The algorithm then uses this information to find all prime numbers in the range [2, limit].

In this code, the variable `n` represents the integer for which we want to find the prime factorization. The variable `factors` is a list that will contain the prime factors of `n`.

The first loop checks if `n` is even. If it is, we add 2 to `factors` and divide `n` by 2. This is because 2 is a prime factor of all even numbers.

The second loop starts at 3 and iterates up to the square root of `n`. For each number `i`, we check if it divides `n`. If it does, we add `i` to `factors` and divide `n` by `i`. This is because `i` is a prime factor of `n` if it divides `n`.

Finally, if `n` is not 2, we add `n` to `factors`. This is because `n` is a prime factor of itself.

The `prime_factorization` function returns a list of prime factors of `n`.

For example, if `n` is 12, the function would return `[2, 2, 3]`.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.</s>  ```
def prime_factorization(n):
    if n == 1:
        return [1]
    
    factors = []
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        while n % i == 0:
            factors.append(i)
            n //= i
    
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)
    
    return factors
```
This code uses a simple trial division algorithm to find the prime factorization of a given integer. It starts by checking if the number is 1, in which case it returns a list containing only 1. If the number is not 1, it loops through all the integers from 2 to the square root of the number, dividing the number by each prime factor until it reaches 1. The resulting prime factors are stored in the `factors` list and returned at the end.</s>  ```
def prime_factorization(n):
    factors = []
    i = 2
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i:
            i += 1
        else:
            n //= i
            factors.append(i)
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)
    return factors
```
This code uses the trial division algorithm to find the prime factorization of a given integer. It starts by iterating from 2 to the square root of the integer, and for each number that divides the integer without leaving a remainder, it divides the integer by that number and appends it to a list of factors. Once the integer is reduced to 1 or a prime number, the list of factors is returned.

For example, if we call the function with the input 120, it will return [2, 2, 2, 3, 5], which represents the prime factorization of 120.

This code does not use any modules, but it does use the // operator to perform integer division and the % operator to check for remainders.</s>  ```
def prime_factorization(n):
    if n == 1:
        return [1]
    
    factors = []
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        while n % i == 0:
            factors.append(i)
            n //= i
    
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)
    
    return factors
```
This code uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to find all the prime factors of a given integer. It starts by initializing an empty list called `factors` and sets the input integer `n` as the upper bound for the loop. It then iterates through the numbers from 2 to the square root of `n`, and checks if `n` is divisible by each number. If it is, it adds the number to the `factors` list and divides `n` by the number. It continues this process until `n` is reduced to 1 or a prime factor. Finally, it returns the `factors` list.

For example, if `n` is 24, the code will return `[2, 2, 2, 3, 3]`. If `n` is 120, the code will return `[2, 2, 2, 3, 5, 5]`.

Note that this code assumes that the input integer `n` is a positive integer. If `n` is a negative integer, it will return an empty list.</s>  ```
def prime_factorization(n):
    factors = []
    i = 2
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i:
            i += 1
        else:
            n //= i
            factors.append(i)
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)
    return factors
```
This code uses a simple loop to iterate over the possible prime factors of the input number `n`, starting from `2` and increasing by `1` each time. It checks if `n` is divisible by the current prime factor `i` using the modulo operator (`%`). If `n` is not divisible, it increments `i` and continues the loop. If `n` is divisible, it divides `n` by the current prime factor and adds it to the list of factors. Finally, if `n` is not a prime number (i.e., it has a non-trivial factor other than `1`), it adds the remaining prime factor to the list of factors.

Note that this code assumes that the input number `n` is positive and non-zero. If the input number is negative or zero, the code will need to be modified to handle those cases as well.</s>  ```

            prime_factors.append(i)
            n = n // i
        else:
            i += 1
    if n > 1:
        prime_factors.append(n)
    return prime_factors

This code uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to find the prime factors of a given integer `n`. The algorithm starts by marking all the numbers up to the square root of `n` as composite, and then iteratively marks as composite any number that is divisible by a prime factor.
