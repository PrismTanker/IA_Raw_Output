Prompt: Check if a given number can be divided by 3 prime numbers.
-------------------
  Here is a test suite for the future solution to the problem of checking if a given number can be divided by 3 prime numbers:
```
from hypothesis import given, strategies

def property_test(candidate_function) -> None:

    @given(strategies.integers(1, 1000000))
    def property_1(n):
        assert candidate_function(n) == (n % 3) == 0

    @given(strategies.integers(1, 1000000))
    def property_2(n):
        assert candidate_function(n) == (n % 5) == 0

    @given(strategies.integers(1, 1000000))
    def property_3(n):
        assert candidate_function(n) == (n % 7) == 0

    return [property_1, property_2, property_3]
```
This test suite uses the Hypothesis library to generate a set of inputs for the candidate function. The inputs are generated using the `strategies.integers` function, which generates a sequence of integers between 1 and 1000000. The `given` decorator is used to indicate that the function is a property test. The property tests are defined using the `assert` statement, which checks that the candidate function returns `True` if the input number is divisible by 3, 5, and 7, and `False` otherwise. The `return` statement is used to return a list of the property tests.

The test suite is designed to test the candidate function for correctness by checking that it returns `True` for inputs that are divisible by 3, 5, and 7, and `False` for inputs that are not divisible by 3, 5, and 7. The test suite is designed to be comprehensive, covering all possible inputs between 1 and 1000000.</s>  To check if a given number can be divided by 3 prime numbers, we can use the following code:
```
def is_divisible_by_prime_numbers(n):
    prime_numbers = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97]
    for prime in prime_numbers:
        if n % prime == 0:
            return True
    return False
```
This code uses a list of prime numbers and checks if the given number can be divided by any of them. If it can, the function returns `True`, otherwise it returns `False`.

You can use this function like this:
```
n = 123
print(is_divisible_by_prime_numbers(n))
```
This will print `False` because 123 is not divisible by any of the prime numbers in the list.

You can also use this function to check if a number is divisible by any of the prime numbers in the range of 2 to 100. For example:
```
n = 99
print(is_divisible_by_prime_numbers(n))
```
This will print `True` because 99 is divisible by 97, which is a prime number in the list.</s>  ```
def is_divisible_by_three_prime_numbers(n):
    # Check if the number is divisible by 3 prime numbers
    for i in range(3, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0 and is_prime(i):
            return True
    return False

def is_prime(n):
    # Check if a number is prime
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```
Explanation:

The first function, `is_divisible_by_three_prime_numbers`, takes a positive integer `n` as input and checks if it can be divided by three prime numbers. It does this by iterating from `3` to the square root of `n` and checking if `n` is divisible by `i` and if `i` is prime. If a prime number is found, the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

The second function, `is_prime`, takes a positive integer `n` as input and checks if it is prime. It does this by iterating from `2` to the square root of `n` and checking if `n` is divisible by `i`. If `n` is not divisible by any number between `2` and the square root of `n`, it is prime. Otherwise, it is not prime.

The code uses the `range` function to generate a sequence of numbers from a start value to an end value, and the `**` operator to calculate the square root of a number. The `int` function is used to convert the result of the `range` function to an integer.</s>  ```
def is_divisible_by_three_prime_numbers(n):
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0 and is_prime(i):
            return True
    return False

def is_prime(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```</s>  To check if a given number can be divided by 3 prime numbers, we can use the following code:
```
def is_divisible_by_3_prime_numbers(n):
    # Check if n is divisible by 3
    if n % 3 == 0:
        return True
    # Check if n is prime
    if is_prime(n):
        return False
    # Check if n is divisible by any of its prime factors
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0 and is_prime(i):
            return False
    return True

def is_prime(n):
    if n == 1 or n == 0:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```
This code first checks if the given number is divisible by 3. If it is, then it returns `True`. If the number is not divisible by 3, it checks if it is prime. If it is not prime, it returns `False`. If the number is prime, it checks if it is divisible by any of its prime factors. If it is, then it returns `False`. If it is not, then it returns `True`.

This code uses the `is_prime` function to check if a number is prime. The `is_prime` function checks if a number is prime by iterating from 2 to the square root of the number and checking if the number is divisible by any of the numbers in that range. If the number is not divisible by any of the numbers in that range, then it is prime.

This code uses the `range` function to generate a range of numbers from 2 to the square root of the number. The `int` function is used to convert the square root of the number to an integer.

This code uses the `**` operator to calculate the square root of the number. The `int` function is used to convert the square root of the number to an integer.

This code does not use any modules. It is a pure Python code that can be run directly in a Python interpreter.</s>  ```
def is_divisible_by_three_prime_numbers(n):
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):

    return False

def is_prime(n):
    if n == 1 or n == 0:

Explanation:

The above code uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to find prime numbers up to the square root of n, and then checks if n can be divided by any of these prime numbers. If it can, then it returns True, otherwise it returns False.

The is_prime() function is a simple implementation of the Sieve of Eratosthenes, which checks if a given number is prime by iterating over all numbers up to the square root of n and checking if n is divisible by any of them.

The is_divisible_by_three_prime_numbers() function takes in a number n and checks if it can be divided by any three prime numbers. It uses the is_prime() function to check if any of the numbers up to the square root of n are prime, and then checks if n can be divided by any of these prime numbers.

Note that the time complexity of the above code is O(n^0.5), which is the time complexity of the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm. The space complexity is O(n), since we need to store all prime numbers up to the square root of n in a list.</s>  ```
def is_divisible_by_3_prime_numbers(n):
    for i in range(3, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0 and is_prime(i):
            return True
    return False

def is_prime(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```
This code first defines a function `is_divisible_by_3_prime_numbers` that takes a positive integer `n` as input. It then defines a function `is_prime` that takes a positive integer `n` as input and returns `True` if `n` is prime and `False` otherwise.

The first function `is_divisible_by_3_prime_numbers` first checks if the input `n` is divisible by 3. If it is, it returns `True`. Otherwise, it iterates over the numbers from 3 to the square root of `n` and checks if each number is prime and divisible by `n`. If it finds a prime number that is divisible by `n`, it returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

The second function `is_prime` first checks if the input `n` is less than or equal to 1. If it is, it returns `False`. Otherwise, it iterates over the numbers from 2 to the square root of `n` and checks if each number is divisible by `n`. If it finds a divisor, it returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True`.

Note that this code uses the `math.sqrt` function to calculate the square root of a number. If you are using Python 2.x, you can use the `math.pow` function instead.</s>  ```
def is_divisible_by_three_prime_numbers(n):
    # Find the prime factors of n
    prime_factors = []
    i = 2
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0:
            prime_factors.append(i)
            n //= i
        else:
            i += 1

    # Check if the prime factors are all equal to 3
    return len(prime_factors) == 3 and all(prime_factors[0] == 3)
```</s>  Here is a Python function that takes in a number and returns True if the number is divisible by 3 prime numbers and False otherwise:
```
def is_divisible_by_3_prime_numbers(n):
    # Check if n is divisible by 3
    if n % 3 == 0:
        return True
    
    # Check if n is prime
    if is_prime(n):
        return True
    
    # Check if n is divisible by 3 prime numbers
    for i in range(1, n):
        if is_prime(i) and n % i == 0:
            return True
    
    return False
```
Here is the is_prime function:
```
def is_prime(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```
This function first checks if the number is divisible by 3. If it is, it returns True. If the number is not divisible by 3, it checks if it is prime. If it is prime, it returns True. If the number is not prime, it checks if it is divisible by 3 prime numbers. If it is, it returns True. If the number is not divisible by 3 prime numbers, it returns False.

The is_prime function takes in a number and returns True if it is prime and False otherwise. It uses a simple primality test to check if a number is prime. It starts by checking if the number is less than or equal to 1, in which case it is not prime. It then checks if the number is divisible by any number between 2 and the square root of the number, in which case it is not prime. If the number is not divisible by any number between 2 and the square root of the number, it is prime.

Explanation:

The first function, `is_divisible_by_three_prime_numbers(n)`, checks if the given number `n` can be divided by three prime numbers. It does this by iterating over the numbers from 2 to the square root of `n` and checking if `n` is divisible by each of them. If any of the numbers are prime and divide `n`, the function returns `True`. If no prime numbers divide `n`, the function returns `False`.

The second function, `is_prime(n)`, checks if a given number `n` is prime. It does this by iterating over the numbers from 2 to the square root of `n` and checking if `n` is divisible by each of them. If `n` is not divisible by any of the numbers from 2 to the square root of `n`, it must be prime.

Note that this solution assumes that the input number `n` is a positive integer. If the input can be a negative integer, additional checks would need to be added to handle that case.</s>  To check if a given number can be divided by 3 prime numbers, we can use the following code:
```
def is_divisible_by_prime_numbers(n):
    # Check if n is a prime number
    if n < 3:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```
This code first checks if the given number `n` is a prime number. If it is not a prime number, it returns `False`. Otherwise, it checks if `n` is divisible by any prime numbers less than or equal to its square root. If it is divisible by a prime number, it returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True`.

Here's an example usage of this function:
```
print(is_divisible_by_prime_numbers(12))  # Output: False
print(is_divisible_by_prime_numbers(15))  # Output: True

```
The above test suite uses the `hypothesis` library to generate property tests for a future solution to the problem. The `property_test` function takes in a candidate function as an argument, and returns a list containing two property tests: `property_1` and `property_2`.

The `property_1` test checks if the candidate function correctly identifies if a given number can be divided by 3 prime numbers by checking if the number is divisible by 3. The test uses the `hypothesis.strategies.integers` strategy to generate a random integer `n` in the range of 1 to 1000, and then checks if the candidate function returns `True` if `n` is divisible by 3 and `False` otherwise.

The `property_2` test checks if the candidate function correctly identifies if a given number cannot be divided by 3 prime numbers by checking if the number is not divisible by 3. The test uses the same `hypothesis.strategies.integers` strategy to generate a random integer `n` in the range of 1 to 1000, and then checks if the candidate function returns `False` if `n` is not divisible by 3 and `True` otherwise.

Overall, the test suite ensures that the candidate function correctly identifies if a given number can be divided by 3 prime numbers and also correctly identifies if a given number cannot be divided by 3 prime numbers.</s>  Here's a Python code to check if a given number can be divided by 3 prime numbers:
```
def is_divisible_by_3_primes(n):

```
This code uses the `is_prime` function to check if a number is prime, and the `is_divisible_by_3_primes` function to check if a number can be divided by 3 prime numbers. The `is_prime` function is an implementation of the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to find prime numbers up to a given number. The `is_divisible_by_3_primes` function iterates over the range of numbers from 2 to the square root of the given number, and checks if the number can be divided by a prime factor. If a prime factor is found, the function returns `True`. If no prime factor is found, the function returns `False`.

Note that this code assumes that the input number `n` is a positive integer. If the input number is not a positive integer, the code will raise a `ValueError`.</s>  To check if a given number can be divided by 3 prime numbers, you can use the following Python code:

            return False
    return True
```
This code uses a loop to check if the given number can be divided by any number between 3 and the square root of the number. If a number is found that divides the given number, it returns `False`. If the loop completes without finding any such number, it returns `True`.

You can use this function as follows:
```
print(is_divisible_by_prime_numbers(12))  # Should print True
print(is_divisible_by_prime_numbers(15))  # Should print False

    for prime in prime_numbers:
        if n % prime == 0:
            return True
    return False
```
This code uses a list of prime numbers and checks if the given number is divisible by any of them. If it is, the function returns `True`, otherwise it returns `False`.

You can also use the `math.gcd` function from the `math` module to check if a number is divisible by any prime numbers.

This code uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to find all prime numbers less than or equal to the square root of n, and then checks if n is divisible by any of the prime numbers. The is_prime function is a simple function that checks if a number is prime.

This code is not the most efficient way to solve this problem, but it is a simple and straightforward solution. If you need a more efficient solution, you can use the Miller-Rabin primality test or the AKS primality test.</s>  To check if a given number can be divided by 3 prime numbers, we can use the following code:

```
This code first checks if the given number `n` is a prime number by checking if it is less than 3 or if it is divisible by 2. If `n` is not a prime number, it returns `False`.

Next, the code checks if `n` is divisible by 3 prime numbers by checking if it is divisible by any number between 3 and the square root of `n`. If `n` is divisible by any of these numbers, it returns `False`.

Finally, if `n` is not divisible by any of these numbers, it returns `True`.

You can use this code to check if a given number can be divided by 3 prime numbers by calling the function with the number you want to check as the argument. For example:
```
n = 12
print(is_divisible_by_3_prime_numbers(n)) # Output: False

n = 15
print(is_divisible_by_3_prime_numbers(n)) # Output: True

Note that this code assumes that the given number `n` is a positive integer. If you want to check if a negative integer can be divided by 3 prime numbers, you will need to modify the code accordingly.</s>  To check if a given number can be divided by 3 prime numbers, we can use the following code:

    return False
```
This code uses a list of prime numbers and checks if the given number `n` can be divided by any of them. If any of the prime numbers divides `n`, the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

The time complexity of this code is O(1) because we are only checking if the given number is divisible by 3 prime numbers. The space complexity is also O(1) because we are only using a constant amount of memory to store the prime numbers.

Note that this code assumes that the given number is positive and non-zero. If the number can be negative or zero, we need to add additional checks to handle those cases.</s>  ```

This code uses the `any()` function to check if any prime factor of the number is divisible by 3. It uses a generator expression to iterate over the range of prime numbers less than or equal to the square root of the number. If any prime factor is divisible by 3, the `any()` function returns `True`, and the function returns `True` if the number is divisible by 3. Otherwise, the function returns `False`.</s>  Here is a Python function that checks if a given number can be divided by 3 prime numbers:

This function works by iterating over the range of numbers from 2 to the square root of the given number, and for each number, it checks if it is divisible by 3. If it is, it continues to the next number. If it is not, it checks if the number is divisible by any of the prime numbers greater than 3. If it is, it returns False, otherwise it returns True.

For example, if we call the function with the number 12, it would return True, because 12 can be divided by 3 and 4, which are both prime numbers. If we call the function with the number 15, it would return False, because 15 cannot be divided by any prime numbers greater than 3.

Please note that this function is not the most efficient way to solve this problem, but it is a simple and straightforward solution that meets the requirements. If you need a more efficient solution, you can use the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to find all prime numbers less than or equal to the given number, and then check if the given number is divisible by any of them.</s>  To check if a given number can be divided by 3 prime numbers, we can use the following code:
```
def is_divisible_by_three_prime_numbers(n):
    # Check if n is divisible by 3
    if n % 3 == 0:
        return True

    # Check if n is divisible by any prime numbers
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0 and is_prime(i):
            return True

    return False

def is_prime(n):
    # Check if n is a prime number
    if n == 1 or n == 2:
        return True

    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False

    return True
```
This code first checks if the number is divisible by 3. If it is, it returns `True`. If not, it checks if the number is divisible by any prime numbers. If it is, it returns `True`. If not, it returns `False`.

The `is_prime` function checks if a number is a prime number. It does this by iterating from 2 to the square root of the number and checking if the number is divisible by any numbers in the range. If it is not divisible by any numbers in the range, it is a prime number.

This code uses the `math.sqrt` function from the `math` module to calculate the square root of the number.

You can test this code using the following test cases:
```
print(is_divisible_by_three_prime_numbers(12))  # Should print True
print(is_divisible_by_three_prime_numbers(15))  # Should print False
print(is_divisible_by_three_prime_numbers(18))  # Should print True
```

        return True
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):

def test_cannot_be_divided_by_3_prime_numbers(n):
    assert not can_be_divided_by_3_prime_numbers(n)
```
In this test suite, we first define the `is_prime` function, which checks if a given number is prime. We then define the `can_be_divided_by_3_prime_numbers` function, which checks if a given number can be divided by 3 prime numbers.

The first test case checks if the function correctly identifies whether a number can be divided by 3 prime numbers or not. We use the `given` strategy from the Hypothesis library to generate a random integer between 1 and 1000000, and then pass it to the `can_be_divided_by_3_prime_numbers` function. The `assert` statement checks if the function returns the correct result.

The second test case checks if the function correctly identifies whether a number cannot be divided by 3 prime numbers or not. We use the `given` strategy to generate a random integer between 1 and 1000000, and then pass it to the `can_be_divided_by_3_prime_numbers` function. The `assert` statement checks if the function returns the correct result.

Overall, this test suite provides a comprehensive test for the `can_be_divided_by_3_prime_numbers` function, covering all possible cases.</s>  ```
from hypothesis import given, strategies

def property_test(candidate_function) -> None:

    @given(strategies.integers(min_value=1))
    def property_1(n):
        assert candidate_function(n) == (n % 3 == 0) or (n % 3 == 1) or (n % 3 == 2)

    @given(strategies.integers(min_value=1))
    def property_2(n):
        assert candidate_function(n) == (n % 3 == 0) or (n % 3 == 1) or (n % 3 == 2)

    return [property_1, property_2]
```
Explanation:

* The `property_test` function takes in a `candidate_function` parameter which is a function that takes an integer `n` as input and returns a boolean indicating whether `n` can be divided by 3 prime numbers.
* The function defines two property tests, `property_1` and `property_2`, using the `hypothesis` library's `given` decorator.
* `property_1` checks whether the candidate function returns the correct value for a given integer `n` when `n` is not divisible by 3. It asserts that the candidate function returns `False` if `n` is not divisible by 3.
* `property_2` checks whether the candidate function returns the correct value for a given integer `n` when `n` is divisible by 3. It asserts that the candidate function returns `True` if `n` is divisible by 3.
* The function returns a list containing the two property tests.

To use the test suite, you can call the `property_test` function and pass in the candidate function you want to test. For example:
```
candidate_function = lambda n: n % 3 == 0 or n % 3 == 1 or n % 3 == 2
property_tests = property_test(candidate_function)
```
Then you can run the property tests by calling the `property_tests` list and passing in the integer `n` you want to test. For example:
```
for property_test in property_tests:
    property_test(5)
```
This will run the `property_1` test for the integer `5` and the `property_2` test for the integer `5`.</s>  ```
def is_divisible_by_3_primes(n):
    # Find the prime factors of n
    prime_factors = []
    i = 2
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0:
            prime_factors.append(i)
            n //= i
        else:
            i += 1

    # Check if the number of prime factors is 3
    return len(prime_factors) == 3
```
Explanation:

This solution finds the prime factors of the given number using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm. Once the prime factors are found, the number of prime factors is checked to see if it is equal to 3. If it is, then the number is divisible by 3 prime numbers.

Note: The Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm is an efficient algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to a given number. It works by iterating from 2 to the given number and marking as composite (not prime) any number that is divisible by a prime number less than or equal to the square root of the number. The resulting list of prime numbers contains all prime numbers up to the given number.</s>  ```
def is_divisible_by_3_prime_numbers(n):
    # Check if the number is divisible by 3
    if n % 3 == 0:
        return True
    else:
        return False
```
This function takes a single argument, `n`, which represents the number to be checked. It first checks if the number is divisible by 3 by using the modulo operator (`%`). If the result is 0, it means the number is divisible by 3, so the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.</s>  ```
def is_divisible_by_three_primes(n):
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```
Explanation:

The function first iterates through the numbers from 2 to n, and checks if each number is divisible by 3. If any number is not divisible by 3, the function returns False immediately. If all numbers are divisible by 3, the function returns True.

The function uses the modulo operator (%) to check if a number is divisible by 3. If the result of the modulo operator is 0, the number is divisible by 3. If the result is not 0, the number is not divisible by 3.

The function uses the range() function to generate a range of numbers from 2 to n. The range() function takes two arguments: the start value and the end value. In this case, the start value is 2 and the end value is n. The range() function generates a sequence of numbers that starts with 2 and ends with n, and includes all numbers in between.

For example, if n = 10, the range() function generates the following sequence of numbers:

2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10

The function iterates through this sequence of numbers and checks if each number is divisible by 3. If any number is not divisible by 3, the function returns False. If all numbers are divisible by 3, the function returns True.

The function does not use any modules or libraries. It is a pure Python function that can be run on any Python interpreter.</s>  To check if a given number can be divided by 3 prime numbers, we can use the following code:
```
def is_divisible_by_three_prime_numbers(n):
    # Check if the number is divisible by 3
    if n % 3 == 0:
        return True

    # Check if the number is divisible by any of the first 10 prime numbers
    for i in range(1, 10):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False

    # If the number is not divisible by any of the first 10 prime numbers, it is not divisible by 3 prime numbers
    return False
```
This code first checks if the number is divisible by 3. If it is, it returns `True`. If not, it checks if the number is divisible by any of the first 10 prime numbers. If it is, it returns `False`. If it is not divisible by any of the first 10 prime numbers, it means that the number is not divisible by 3 prime numbers, so it returns `False`.

To test this code, we can use the following test cases:
```
assert is_divisible_by_three_prime_numbers(9) == True
assert is_divisible_by_three_prime_numbers(12) == False
assert is_divisible_by_three_prime_numbers(15) == True
assert is_divisible_by_three_prime_numbers(18) == False
assert is_divisible_by_three_prime_numbers(21) == True
assert is_divisible_by_three_prime_numbers(24) == False
assert is_divisible_by_three_prime_numbers(27) == True
assert is_divisible_by_three_prime_numbers(30) == False
assert is_divisible_by_three_prime_numbers(33) == True
assert is_divisible_by_three_prime_numbers(36) == False
```
This will run the code on the test cases and ensure that it is working correctly.</s>  To check if a given number can be divided by 3 prime numbers, we can use the following code:
```
def is_divisible_by_3_prime_numbers(n):
    # Check if n is a prime number
    if is_prime(n):
        return True

    # Check if n is divisible by 3
    if n % 3 == 0:
        return True

    # Check if n is divisible by any of the 3 prime numbers
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if i % 3 == 0 and n % i == 0:
            return True

    return False

def is_prime(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```
This code first checks if the number is a prime number. If it is, it returns `True`. If it's not, it checks if the number is divisible by 3. If it is, it returns `True`. Otherwise, it iterates through the numbers from 2 to the square root of `n` and checks if any of them are divisible by 3 and if `n` is divisible by them. If any of the conditions are met, the function returns `True`, otherwise it returns `False`.

Note that this code uses the `is_prime` function, which is not included in the standard library. It can be implemented as follows:
```
def is_prime(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```
This function checks if a number is prime by iterating through the numbers from 2 to the square root of `n` and checking if any of them divide `n`.</s>  To check if a number can be divided by 3 prime numbers, we can use the following code:
```
def is_divisible_by_3_primes(n):
    if n == 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```
This code uses a loop to iterate through the numbers from 2 to the square root of the given number, and checks if the number is divisible by any of the prime numbers in the range. If the number is not divisible by any prime numbers, it means it can be divided by 3 prime numbers, and the function returns `True`. If the number is divisible by a prime number, it means it cannot be divided by 3 prime numbers, and the function returns `False`.

For example, if we call the function with the number 12, the function will return `False` because 12 is divisible by 3, which means it cannot be divided by 3 prime numbers. If we call the function with the number 9, the function will return `True` because 9 is not divisible by any prime numbers, which means it can be divided by 3 prime numbers.

This code uses the `range()` function to generate a range of numbers from 2 to the square root of the given number, and the `for` loop to iterate through the range and check if the number is divisible by any of the prime numbers in the range. The `int()` function is used to convert the square root of the given number to an integer, because the `range()` function generates a range of integers by default.</s>  To check if a given number can be divided by 3 prime numbers, we can use the following code:
```
def is_divisible_by_3_prime_numbers(n):
    # Check if n is a prime number
    if is_prime(n):
        return True

    # Check if n is divisible by 3 prime numbers
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if is_prime(i) and n % i == 0:
            return True

    return False

def is_prime(n):
    if n <= 1 or n % 2 == 0:
        return False

    for i in range(3, int(n ** 0.5) + 1, 2):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False

    return True
```
Explanation:

The `is_divisible_by_3_prime_numbers` function first checks if the given number `n` is a prime number. If it is not a prime number, then it checks if `n` is divisible by 3 prime numbers by iterating from 2 to the square root of `n` and checking if `n` is divisible by any prime number between 2 and the square root of `n`. If `n` is not divisible by any prime number between 2 and the square root of `n`, then it returns `False`.

The `is_prime` function is used to check if a given number `n` is a prime number. It uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to find all prime numbers up to the square root of `n`.

Note that this solution uses the `math.sqrt` function to calculate the square root of `n` which is more efficient than using a loop to find the square root of `n`.</s>  ```

```
This code first checks if the given number is divisible by 3. If it is, it returns `True`. If it's not, it checks if the number is prime. If it's not prime, it checks if the number is divisible by 3 prime numbers. If it's not, it returns `False`. If it is, it returns `True`.

The `is_prime` function checks if a number is prime by checking if it's less than 2, if it's divisible by 2, and if it's divisible by all odd numbers up to the square root of the number.

The code uses the `math.sqrt` function from the `math` module to calculate the square root of the number, and the `range` function from the `builtins` module to generate the range of odd numbers up to the square root of the number.</s>  ```
def is_divisible_by_three_prime_numbers(n):
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):

    return False

def is_prime(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```
This code first defines two functions: `is_divisible_by_three_prime_numbers` and `is_prime`. The former checks if a given number `n` can be divided by at least three prime numbers, while the latter checks if a given number `n` is prime.

The `is_divisible_by_three_prime_numbers` function uses a loop to iterate over all numbers from `2` to `n ** 0.5`, inclusive. For each number `i`, it checks if `n` is divisible by `i` and if `i` is prime using the `is_prime` function. If the `is_prime` function returns `True` for `i`, the `is_divisible_by_three_prime_numbers` function returns `True`. Otherwise, the function continues to the next iteration.

The `is_prime` function uses a similar approach to check if a given number `n` is prime. It checks if `n` is less than or equal to `1`, and if it is, it returns `False`. Otherwise, it uses a loop to iterate over all numbers from `2` to `n ** 0.5`, inclusive. For each number `i`, it checks if `n` is divisible by `i`. If the `n` is divisible by `i`, the `is_prime` function returns `False`. Otherwise, the function continues to the next iteration.

Note that the time complexity of this code is O(sqrt(n)), which is the same as the time complexity of the `is_prime` function. The space complexity is also O(1), since we only need to store the value of `n` and the result of the `is_prime` function.</s>  ```
def is_divisible_by_three_primes(n):
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0 and is_prime(i) and is_prime(n // i):
            return True
    return False

def is_prime(n):
    if n <= 1 or n % 2 == 0:

        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```
This code uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to find prime numbers up to the square root of the input number, and then checks if the input number is divisible by two prime factors.

The is_prime() function uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to find prime numbers up to the square root of the input number. It returns True if the input number is prime, and False otherwise.

The is_divisible_by_three_primes() function uses the is_prime() function to check if the input number is divisible by two prime factors. It returns True if the input number is divisible by three prime numbers, and False otherwise.</s>

The `prime_factors` function takes a number as input and returns a list of its prime factors. It uses a simple iterative algorithm to find the prime factors of a number.

This code uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to find all prime numbers up to the square root of n, and then checks if n is divisible by any of these prime numbers.

The is_prime function uses a simple implementation of the Sieve of Eratosthenes to determine if a number is prime.

The is_divisible_by_three_prime_numbers function first checks if n is divisible by 3, and then checks if n is prime. If it is not prime, it checks if n is divisible by any of the prime numbers less than or equal to its square root. If it is divisible by a prime number, it returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.</s>  ```

This code uses a simple algorithm to find the prime factors of a given number n. It starts with i = 2 and iterates until i * i > n. If n is divisible by i, it adds i to the list of prime factors and divides n by i. If n is not divisible by i, it increments i and tries the next prime factor. Once i > n, it checks if n is a prime factor and adds it to the list if it is. Finally, it returns True if the length of the list of prime factors is at least 3, indicating that n can be divided by at least 3 prime numbers.</s>
