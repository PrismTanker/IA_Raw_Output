This test suite covers all the different scenarios that can occur when adding two numbers. It includes positive and negative integers, decimals, and mixed numbers. It also includes different order of operations, such as adding two positive numbers or two negative decimals. This test suite is comprehensive enough to test all the possible cases that can occur when adding two numbers.</s>  ```
def add_numbers(a, b):
    return a + b
```
This code uses the `+` operator to add the two numbers. The `add_numbers` function takes two arguments, `a` and `b`, and returns their sum.

Here is an example of how you can use this function:
```
print(add_numbers(2, 3))  # Output: 5
```
This will print `5`, which is the sum of `2` and `3`.

Note that this function only adds two numbers. If you want to add more numbers, you can modify the function to take a variable number of arguments, like this:
```
def add_numbers(*numbers):
    return sum(numbers)
```
This function takes a variable number of arguments and returns their sum. You can use it like this:
```
print(add_numbers(2, 3, 4, 5))  # Output: 14
```
This will print `14`, which is the sum of `2`, `3`, `4`, and `5`.</s>  ```
def add(a, b):
    return a + b
```
This function takes two integer arguments `a` and `b` and returns their sum.

Here is an example usage of the function:
```
print(add(3, 5)) # Output: 8
```
This code will print the result of adding 3 and 5, which is 8.

Note: This function is a basic example of a function that takes two integer arguments and returns their sum. In practice, you may need to handle more complex cases, such as non-integer inputs or negative numbers.</s>  ```
def add(a, b):
    return a + b
```
This code defines a function called `add` that takes two arguments, `a` and `b`, and returns their sum. The `+` operator is used to perform the addition.

Here are some examples of how the `add` function can be used:
```
>>> add(3, 4)
7
>>> add(5, 6)
11
>>> add(1, 2)
3
```
This function can be used to add two numbers together and return the result.</s>  ```
def add(x, y):
    return x + y
```
This code defines a function `add` that takes two arguments `x` and `y` and returns their sum. The function uses the `+` operator to add the two numbers.

This function can be used as follows:
```
print(add(3, 4))  # prints 7
print(add(5, 6))  # prints 11
```
This code will first call the `add` function with the arguments `3` and `4`, and then print the result, which is `7`. It will then call the `add` function with the arguments `5` and `6`, and print the result, which is `11`.

This code uses no external modules, but it is a very basic example of a function that takes two arguments and returns their sum.</s>  ```
def add(a, b):
    return a + b
```
This function takes two numbers as input and returns their sum. It does not use any external modules.

Here are some test cases to demonstrate how the function works:
```
assert add(3, 5) == 8
assert add(10, 2) == 12
assert add(5, -3) == 2
```
These test cases show that the function correctly adds the two numbers together.</s>  ```
def add(a, b):
    return a + b
```
This code defines a function called `add` that takes two arguments `a` and `b`. The function returns the sum of `a` and `b`.

Here's an example of how you can use this function:
```
print(add(3, 5))  # Output: 8
```
This will print `8`, which is the sum of `3` and `5`.</s>  ```
def add_two_numbers(a, b):
    return a + b
```
This code defines a function called `add_two_numbers` that takes two arguments `a` and `b`. The function returns the sum of these two numbers.

The function can be tested with the following code:
```
assert add_two_numbers(3, 5) == 8
assert add_two_numbers(-3, 5) == 2
assert add_two_numbers(3, -5) == -2
assert add_two_numbers(0, 0) == 0
```
All of these tests should pass, indicating that the function is working correctly.</s>  ```
def add_two_numbers(a, b):
    return a + b
```
This code defines a function `add_two_numbers` that takes two arguments `a` and `b` and returns their sum. The function uses the `+` operator to perform the addition.

Here is an example of how to use this function:
```
print(add_two_numbers(3, 4))  # prints 7
```
This code calls the `add_two_numbers` function with the arguments `3` and `4`, and prints the result to the console.

This code satisfies the requirements of the problem and passes the given test cases.</s>  ```
def add(a, b):
    return a + b
```
This code uses the `+` operator to add two numbers together and returns the result. The `a` and `b` parameters are the two numbers to be added, and the function returns the sum of these numbers.

Here are some examples of how this function can be used:
```
print(add(3, 4))  # Output: 7
print(add(5, 6))  # Output: 11
print(add(7, 8))  # Output: 15
```
This code passes the test cases provided, as it correctly returns the sum of the two numbers.</s>  ```
def add_numbers(a, b):
    return a + b
```
This code defines a function `add_numbers` that takes two arguments `a` and `b` and returns their sum. The function uses the `+` operator to add the two numbers.

To test the function, you can use the following code:
```
assert add_numbers(3, 5) == 8
assert add_numbers(-3, 5) == 2
assert add_numbers(3, -5) == -2
```
These test cases check that the function works for positive and negative numbers, and that the results are correct.</s>
