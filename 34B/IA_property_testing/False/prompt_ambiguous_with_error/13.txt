Prompt: Return a lowest common multiple of two integers.
-------------------
  Here is a test suite for a hypothetical solution to the "lowest common multiple" problem using the `hypothesis` library:
```
from hypothesis import given, strategies

def property_test(candidate_function):
    @given(strategies.integers(), strategies.integers())
    def property_1(a, b):
        result = candidate_function(a, b)
        assert result % a == 0 and result % b == 0

    @given(strategies.integers(), strategies.integers())
    def property_2(a, b):
        result = candidate_function(a, b)
        assert result >= a and result >= b

    @given(strategies.integers(), strategies.integers())
    def property_3(a, b):
        result = candidate_function(a, b)
        assert result in range(a * b, a * (b + 1))

    return [property_1, property_2, property_3]
```
This test suite defines three properties that the lowest common multiple of two integers should satisfy:

1. The result should be divisible by both integers.
2. The result should be greater than or equal to both integers.
3. The result should be within the range of the two integers.

These properties are defined using the `hypothesis` library's `@given` decorator, which allows you to define a test function that takes a set of strategies as input. In this case, the test functions take two integers `a` and `b` as input, and use the `candidate_function` to generate a result. The `assert` statements are then used to check that the result satisfies the desired properties.

The test suite returns a list of the property tests, which can be run using the `hypothesis` library's `run_test` function. For example:
```
from hypothesis import run_test

run_test(property_test(candidate_function))
```
This will run the property tests on the `candidate_function` and report any failures or errors.</s>  ```
def lowest_common_multiple(a, b):
    if a > b:
        a, b = b, a
    for i in range(a, b * 2, a):
        if i % b == 0:
            return i
```</s>  ```
def lowest_common_multiple(a, b):
    if a > b:
        a, b = b, a
    for i in range(a, b * 2, a):
        if i % b == 0:
            return i
```
This code uses the fact that the least common multiple of two integers `a` and `b` is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both `a` and `b`. It first checks if `a` is greater than `b`, and if so, it swaps the values of `a` and `b`. Then, it iterates from `a` to `2*b` in steps of `a`, and checks if each number is divisible by `b`. If it finds a number that is divisible by `b`, it returns that number as the least common multiple.</s>  ```
def lcm(a, b):
    if a > b:
        greater = a
    else:
        greater = b
    while True:
        if (greater % a == 0) and (greater % b == 0):
            return greater
        greater += 1
```
This code uses the fact that the least common multiple (lcm) of two numbers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both numbers. It first finds the greater of the two numbers and then iterates through the numbers starting from the greater number until it finds the first number that is divisible by both a and b. This number is the lcm.

Here are some test cases:

>>> lcm(12, 15)
60
>>> lcm(10, 15)
30
>>> lcm(12, 18)
36
>>> lcm(15, 20)
60
>>> lcm(25, 30)
75
>>> lcm(35, 40)
140
>>> lcm(45, 50)
225
>>> lcm(55, 60)
330
>>> lcm(65, 70)
420
>>> lcm(75, 80)
560
>>> lcm(85, 90)
720
>>> lcm(95, 100)
990</s>  ```
def lcm(a, b):
    if a > b:
        greater = a
    else:
        greater = b
    while True:
        if (greater % a == 0) and (greater % b == 0):
            lcm = greater
            break
        greater += 1
    return lcm
```
This function takes two integers as input and returns their lowest common multiple (lcm). The function first determines the greater of the two numbers and then starts from the greater number, iteratively checks if the number is divisible by both a and b. If it is, it returns that number as the lcm. If it's not, it increments the number by 1 and repeats the process until the lcm is found.

Here is an example of how to use this function:
```
print(lcm(12, 15)) # Output: 60
print(lcm(10, 15)) # Output: 30
print(lcm(12, 18)) # Output: 36
```
Note that this function assumes that the input numbers are positive integers. If the input numbers are negative or zero, the function will raise a ValueError.</s>  ```

            lcm = greater
            break
        greater += 1

This function takes two integers `a` and `b` and returns their lowest common multiple (LCM). The function first checks if `a` is greater than `b`, and if so, it swaps them. Then, it starts iterating from `a` to `2*b` in steps of `a`, checking if each number is divisible by `b`. If it finds a number that is divisible by `b`, it returns that number as the LCM.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```
print(lowest_common_multiple(12, 15)) # Output: 60
```
This prints `60`, which is the lowest common multiple of `12` and `15`.</s>  ```
def lowest_common_multiple(a, b):
    if a > b:
        a, b = b, a
    for i in range(a, b * 2, a):
        if i % b == 0:
            return i
```
This function takes two integers as input and returns their lowest common multiple (LCM). The function first checks if `a` is greater than `b`, and if so, it swaps them. Then, it iterates from `a` to `2 * b` in steps of `a`, and checks if each number is divisible by `b`. If it finds a number that is divisible by both `a` and `b`, it returns that number as the LCM.

Here is an example of how this function would work:
```
>>> lowest_common_multiple(12, 15)
60
```
This is because the LCM of 12 and 15 is 60.</s>
