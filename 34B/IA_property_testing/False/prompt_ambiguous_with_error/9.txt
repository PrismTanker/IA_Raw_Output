Prompt: Generate a list of rolling maximum element found before given moment in list of integers.
-------------------
  Here's a possible test suite for the problem of generating a list of rolling maximum element found before a given moment in a list of integers:
```
from hypothesis import given, strategies

def property_test(candidate_function) -> None:
    @given(strategies.lists(strategies.integers(), min_size=1), strategies.integers(min_value=0))
    def property_1(input_list, moment):
        # Check that the rolling maximum element is correct
        expected_result = []
        for i in range(moment):
            expected_result.append(max(input_list[:i+1]))
        assert candidate_function(input_list, moment) == expected_result

    @given(strategies.lists(strategies.integers(), min_size=1), strategies.integers(min_value=0))
    def property_2(input_list, moment):
        # Check that the function returns a list of the same length as the input list
        assert len(candidate_function(input_list, moment)) == len(input_list)

    return [property_1, property_2]
```
This test suite tests two properties of the function:

1. The function returns a list of the same length as the input list.
2. The function returns the correct rolling maximum element for each element in the list.

The test suite uses the `hypothesis` library to generate random inputs for the function, and checks that the function returns the expected result for those inputs.</s>  ```
def get_rolling_max(my_list, moment):
    return my_list[:moment] + [max(my_list[:moment])]
```
This function takes two arguments: `my_list`, which is the list of integers, and `moment`, which is the moment at which the rolling maximum is to be computed.

The function first slices the list up to the given moment, and then uses the `max` function to find the maximum value in that slice. This maximum value is then appended to the slice, resulting in a list of the rolling maximum values up to the given moment.

For example, if `my_list` is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and `moment` is `3`, the function will return `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5]`. The first 3 elements of the list are the same as the original list, and the last element is the maximum value in the first 3 elements, which is `5`.</s>  ```
def get_rolling_maximum(my_list):
    return [max(my_list[:i+1]) for i in range(len(my_list))]
```
Here's an explanation of how the code works:

1. The `get_rolling_maximum` function takes a list of integers as input.
2. We use a list comprehension to create a new list that contains the rolling maximum element found before each element in the input list.
3. The `max` function is used to find the maximum element in the list up to the current element.
4. The `range` function is used to generate a sequence of numbers from 0 to the length of the input list.
5. The `for` loop iterates over the sequence of numbers and uses each number as the index for the `max` function.
6. The resulting list of rolling maximum elements is returned by the function.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```
my_list = [3, 5, 2, 7, 11, 9]
print(get_rolling_maximum(my_list)) # [3, 5, 5, 7, 11, 11]
```
In this example, the function returns a list of rolling maximum elements: [3, 5, 5, 7, 11, 11]. The first element in the list is the maximum element found before the first element, which is 3. The second element is the maximum element found before the second element, which is 5. The third element is the maximum element found before the third element, which is also 5. The fourth element is the maximum element found before the fourth element, which is 7. The fifth element is the maximum element found before the fifth element, which is 11. The sixth element is the maximum element found before the sixth element, which is also 11.</s>  ```
def rolling_max(arr):
    max_list = []
    current_max = float('-inf')
    for num in arr:
        if num > current_max:
            current_max = num
        max_list.append(current_max)
    return max_list
```
This function takes in a list of integers and returns a list of the rolling maximum value found before each element in the original list.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
print(rolling_max(arr)) # [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
```
This will output the list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`, which is the list of rolling maximum values found before each element in the original list.</s>  ```
def rolling_max(my_list, moment):
    return max(my_list[:moment])
```
This function takes a list of integers and a moment as input, and returns the maximum element found before the given moment in the list.

Here's an example usage:
```
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
moment = 5
print(rolling_max(my_list, moment)) # Output: 5
```</s>  ```
def get_rolling_maximum(arr):
    max_so_far = -float('inf')
    result = []
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        if arr[i] > max_so_far:
            max_so_far = arr[i]
        result.append(max_so_far)
    return result
```
This function takes a list of integers as input, and returns a list of the rolling maximum element found before each element in the input list. The rolling maximum is calculated using a variable `max_so_far` that keeps track of the maximum value seen so far. The function uses a list comprehension to create the output list.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```
arr = [3, 2, 5, 1, 4, 7, 6, 9]
print(get_rolling_maximum(arr)) # Output: [3, 3, 5, 5, 7, 7, 9, 9]
```
In this example, the function returns the list `[3, 3, 5, 5, 7, 7, 9, 9]`, which represents the rolling maximum element found before each element in the input list.</s>  ```
def rolling_max(my_list):
    result = []
    current_max = float("-inf")
    for i in range(len(my_list)):
        if my_list[i] > current_max:
            current_max = my_list[i]
        result.append(current_max)
    return result
```</s>  ```
def rolling_max(my_list):
    max_list = []
    current_max = float('-inf')
    for i in range(len(my_list)):
        if my_list[i] > current_max:
            current_max = my_list[i]
        max_list.append(current_max)
    return max_list
```
This code uses a single loop to iterate over the input list and maintain a running maximum value. The `current_max` variable is initialized to `float('-inf')` to ensure that the first element of the list is always included in the output.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```
my_list = [3, 2, 5, 1, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10]
print(rolling_max(my_list))  # [3, 3, 5, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 10]
```</s>  ```
def rolling_max(my_list):
    result = []
    current_max = float('-inf')
    for i in range(len(my_list)):
        if my_list[i] > current_max:
            current_max = my_list[i]
        result.append(current_max)
    return result
```
Example:
```
my_list = [3, 2, 5, 1, 4]
print(rolling_max(my_list)) # [3, 3, 5, 5, 5]
```</s>  ```
def get_rolling_maximum(my_list):
    result = []
    current_max = float('-inf')
    for i in range(len(my_list)):
        if my_list[i] > current_max:
            current_max = my_list[i]
        result.append(current_max)
    return result
```

This function takes a list of integers as input and returns a list of the rolling maximum element found before each moment in the list. The function uses a variable `current_max` to keep track of the current maximum element and a list `result` to store the rolling maximum values.

For each element in the input list, the function checks if the element is greater than the current maximum. If it is, the function updates the current maximum and adds it to the `result` list. If the element is not greater than the current maximum, the function simply adds the current maximum to the `result` list.

Here is an example usage of the function:
```
my_list = [3, 2, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17]
result = get_rolling_maximum(my_list)
print(result) # [3, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17]
```
This code will output the list `[3, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17]`. The first element is the maximum value in the first moment, which is 3. The second element is the maximum value in the second moment, which is also 3. The third element is the maximum value in the third moment, which is 5. And so on.</s>  ```
def rolling_max(my_list, moment):
    return max(my_list[:moment])
```
This function takes two arguments: `my_list` is the list of integers, and `moment` is the moment at which the maximum element should be calculated. The function returns the maximum element found before the given moment.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
moment = 5
print(rolling_max(my_list, moment)) # Output: 5
```
In this example, the function returns the maximum element found before the 5th moment, which is 5.</s>
