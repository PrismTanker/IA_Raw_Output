Prompt: Check if there is equal open and close brackets.
-------------------
  Here is a sample test suite to test a function that checks if there is an equal number of open and close brackets in a string:
```
{
    "test_empty_string": {
        "in": {
            "input_string": ""
        },
        "out": true
    },
    "test_single_bracket": {
        "in": {
            "input_string": "("
        },
        "out": false
    },
    "test_missing_close_bracket": {
        "in": {
            "input_string": "("
        },
        "out": false
    },
    "test_matching_brackets": {
        "in": {
            "input_string": "()[]{}[]"
        },
        "out": true
    },
    "test_unmatching_brackets": {
        "in": {
            "input_string": "([)]"
        },
        "out": false
    }
}
```
This test suite includes the following tests:

* `test_empty_string`: Tests if an empty string is considered balanced.
* `test_single_bracket`: Tests if a single opening bracket is considered unbalanced.
* `test_missing_close_bracket`: Tests if a missing closing bracket is considered unbalanced.
* `test_matching_brackets`: Tests if a string with matching opening and closing brackets is considered balanced.
* `test_unmatching_brackets`: Tests if a string with unmatching opening and closing brackets is considered unbalanced.</s>  ```
def is_balanced(expression):
    open_brackets = expression.count("(")
    close_brackets = expression.count(")")
    if open_brackets == close_brackets:
        return True
    else:
        return False
```
This code uses the `count()` method to count the number of opening and closing brackets in the expression. It then checks if the number of opening and closing brackets are equal, and returns `True` if they are, and `False` otherwise.</s>  ```
def is_balanced_brackets(expression):
    stack = []
    for char in expression:
        if char == '(' or char == '[' or char == '{':
            stack.append(char)
        elif char == ')' or char == ']' or char == '}':
            if not stack:
                return False
            top = stack.pop()
            if (top == '(' and char != ')') or (top == '[' and char != ']') or (top == '{' and char != '}'):
                return False
    return not stack
```
This code uses a stack data structure to keep track of the open brackets as they are encountered, and then checks that each close bracket is properly matched to an open bracket. The `stack` variable is initialized to an empty list, and then the expression is traversed character by character. If a open bracket is encountered, it is pushed onto the stack. If a close bracket is encountered, it is popped from the stack and checked to make sure it matches the most recently pushed open bracket. If the stack is empty at the end of the traversal, the expression is considered balanced. If the stack is not empty at the end of the traversal, the expression is not balanced.</s>  ```
def is_balanced(expression):
    open_brackets = []
    for char in expression:
        if char == '(':
            open_brackets.append(char)
        elif char == ')':
            if not open_brackets:
                return False
            open_brackets.pop()
    return not open_brackets
```
This code uses a stack to keep track of the open brackets and pops them off when it encounters a closing bracket. If the stack is empty at the end of the expression, it means that all the open brackets have been closed, so the expression is balanced. If there are still open brackets in the stack, then the expression is not balanced.</s>  ```
def is_balanced(expression):
    open_brackets = expression.count("(")
    close_brackets = expression.count(")")
    return open_brackets == close_brackets
```
This function takes in a string `expression` and checks if the number of open brackets is equal to the number of close brackets. If they are equal, the expression is balanced, otherwise it is not.

For example, if `expression` is `"()()"`, the function will return `True` because there is an equal number of open and close brackets. If `expression` is `"(()"` or `")()"`, the function will return `False` because there are more open brackets than close brackets.</s>  ```
def validate_brackets(expression):
    open_brackets = []
    for char in expression:
        if char == "(":
            open_brackets.append(char)
        elif char == ")":
            if not open_brackets:
                return False
            open_brackets.pop()
    return not open_brackets
```
This code uses a stack data structure to keep track of the open brackets. It iterates through the expression and checks if the current character is an opening bracket. If it is, it adds it to the stack. If it is a closing bracket, it checks if the stack is empty. If it is, it returns False, indicating that there are more closing brackets than opening brackets. If it is not, it pops the last opening bracket off the stack. If the stack is empty at the end, it means that there are as many closing brackets as opening brackets, and the expression is valid.</s>  ```
def is_balanced_brackets(expression):
    open_brackets = []
    for char in expression:
        if char == "(":
            open_brackets.append(char)
        elif char == ")":
            if not open_brackets:
                return False
            open_brackets.pop()
    return not open_brackets
```
This code uses a stack to keep track of the open brackets. When it encounters a closing bracket, it checks if the stack is empty, if it is, it returns False. If it is not empty, it pops the top element from the stack. At the end, if the stack is not empty, it returns False, otherwise it returns True.

This code will work for any expression with balanced brackets, including nested ones.

It's worth noting that this code assumes that the input is a string, and that the only brackets that are considered are "(" and ")".</s>  ```
def check_brackets(string):
    open_brackets = ["(", "{", "[", "<"]
    close_brackets = [")", "}", "]", ">"]
    stack = []
    for char in string:
        if char in open_brackets:
            stack.append(char)
        elif char in close_brackets:
            if not stack or open_brackets.index(stack.pop()) != close_brackets.index(char):
                return False
    return not stack
```
This code uses a stack to keep track of the open brackets, and checks if the closing brackets are balanced by comparing the open and close brackets. It returns False if there are unbalanced brackets, and True if there are no unbalanced brackets.</s>  To check if there are equal open and close brackets in a string, you can use the `re` module in Python. Here's an example of how you can do this:
```
import re

def check_brackets(string):
    return len(re.findall(r'\(', string)) == len(re.findall(r'\)', string))
```
This function takes a string as input and uses the `re.findall()` method to find the number of open and close brackets in the string. It then compares the number of open brackets to the number of close brackets, and returns `True` if they are equal, and `False` otherwise.

For example, if you call the function with the string `'()'`, it will return `True`, since there are an equal number of open and close brackets. If you call the function with the string `'()('`, it will return `False`, since there are more open brackets than close brackets.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.</s>  ```
def is_balanced(string):
    stack = []
    for char in string:
        if char == '(':
            stack.append(char)
        elif char == ')':
            if not stack:
                return False
            stack.pop()
    return not stack
```</s>  ```
def is_balanced_brackets(expression):
    open_brackets = expression.count("(")
    close_brackets = expression.count(")")
    return open_brackets == close_brackets
```
This code uses the `count` method of strings to count the number of open and close brackets in the input expression. It then compares the two values to determine if there are an equal number of open and close brackets. If the two values are equal, then the expression is balanced, otherwise it is not balanced.</s>
