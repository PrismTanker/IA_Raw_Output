Prompt: Perform binary XOR on two strings consisting of 1's and 0's.
-------------------
  Sure, here's a test suite to test a future solution for the problem:
```
{
    "test_binary_xor_1": {
        "in": {
            "str1": "11110000",
            "str2": "00001111"
        },
        "out": "10101111"
    },
    "test_binary_xor_2": {
        "in": {
            "str1": "01010101",
            "str2": "11111111"
        },
        "out": "10111010"
    },
    "test_binary_xor_3": {
        "in": {
            "str1": "11110000",
            "str2": "11110000"
        },
        "out": "00000000"
    },
    "test_binary_xor_4": {
        "in": {
            "str1": "00000000",
            "str2": "00000000"
        },
        "out": "00000000"
    },
    "test_binary_xor_5": {
        "in": {
            "str1": "11111111",
            "str2": "11111111"
        },
        "out": "00000000"
    }
}
```
This test suite contains five tests, each with a different input string and expected output. The input strings are all binary strings consisting of 1's and 0's. The output of each test is the binary XOR of the corresponding input strings.</s>  ```
def binary_xor(str1, str2):
    result = ''
    for i in range(len(str1)):
        if str1[i] != str2[i]:
            result += '1'
        else:
            result += '0'
    return result
```</s>  ```
def binary_xor(str1, str2):
    result = ""
    for i in range(len(str1)):
        if str1[i] != str2[i]:
            result += "1"
        else:
            result += "0"
    return result
```
This code uses a for loop to iterate through each character in the two input strings. For each character, it checks if the corresponding characters in the two strings are the same (i.e., have the same value). If they are the same, the result is 0, otherwise it is 1. Finally, the resulting string is returned.</s>  To perform binary XOR on two strings consisting of 1's and 0's, you can use the built-in `zip()` function in Python to iterate over the characters of the two strings simultaneously, and then use the `^` operator to perform the XOR operation.
```
def binary_xor(str1, str2):
    result = ''
    for char1, char2 in zip(str1, str2):
        result += str(int(char1) ^ int(char2))
    return result
```
This function takes two strings as input, and returns a new string that is the binary XOR of the two input strings.

For example, if `str1 = "10101010"` and `str2 = "01010101"`, then the output of the function would be `"11111111"`.

Note that this function assumes that the input strings are composed only of 1's and 0's. If the input strings contain other characters, the function will raise a `ValueError`.</s>  ```
def binary_xor(str1, str2):
    return ''.join(str(int(a) ^ int(b)) for a, b in zip(str1, str2))
```
This code uses the `zip()` function to iterate over the characters of both strings simultaneously, and the `int()` function to convert each character to an integer. Then, it uses the bitwise XOR operator (`^`) to perform the binary XOR operation between the two integers, and finally it converts the result back to a string using the `str()` function.

Note that this code assumes that both strings have the same length. If the strings have different lengths, the result will be shorter than the longer string. Also, this code assumes that the strings only contain 1's and 0's. If the strings contain other characters, the result will be incorrect.</s>  ```
def binary_xor(str1, str2):
    return "".join([str(int(c1) ^ int(c2)) for c1, c2 in zip(str1, str2)])
```</s>
