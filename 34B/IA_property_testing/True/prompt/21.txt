-------------------
  Here's a test suite using the `hypothesis` library to test the `rescale_to_unit` function:
```python
from hypothesis import given, strategies

def property_test(candidate_function):
    @given(strategies.lists(strategies.floats(min_value=0, max_value=100), min_size=2))
    def test_rescale_to_unit(numbers):
        result = candidate_function(numbers)
        assert all(0 <= x <= 1 for x in result)
        assert result[0] == 0
        assert result[-1] == 1

    return [test_rescale_to_unit]
```
This test suite uses the `strategies.lists` strategy to generate lists of floats, with a minimum size of 2 and a maximum value of 100. The `test_rescale_to_unit` function takes such a list as input, applies the `candidate_function` (i.e. the `rescale_to_unit` function), and then checks that the resulting list is within the required range of 0 to 1, and that the first and last elements are 0 and 1, respectively.

This test suite can be run using the `hypothesis` library, which will generate random inputs and run the test function multiple times, ensuring that the `rescale_to_unit` function is correctly implemented.</s>

```
This code uses a list comprehension to apply the linear transformation to each element in the input list. The transformation is defined as `x' = (x - min) / (max - min)`, where `x` is the original value, `min` is the minimum value in the list, and `max` is the maximum value in the list. This transformation maps the original values to the range `[0, 1]`.

To test this function, you can use the following code:
```
numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0]
result = rescale_to_unit(numbers)
print(result)  # [0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0]

    smallest = min(numbers)
    largest = max(numbers)
    return [(x - smallest) / (largest - smallest) for x in numbers]
```
This code first finds the smallest and largest numbers in the list using the `min` and `max` functions, respectively. Then, it applies the linear transformation to each number in the list using a list comprehension, which maps each number to the corresponding scaled value. The scaled value is calculated by subtracting the smallest number and then dividing by the difference between the largest and smallest numbers. This transformation ensures that the smallest number is scaled to 0 and the largest number is scaled to 1.</s>  ```

  Sure, here's a test suite using the Hypothesis library to test a future solution for the `rescale_to_unit` function:
```python
from hypothesis import given, strategies

def property_test(candidate_function):
    @given(strategies.lists(strategies.floats(min_value=0, max_value=10), min_size=2))
    def property_1(numbers):
        rescaled_numbers = candidate_function(numbers)
        assert all(0 <= x <= 1 for x in rescaled_numbers)

    @given(strategies.lists(strategies.floats(min_value=0, max_value=10), min_size=2))
    def property_2(numbers):
        rescaled_numbers = candidate_function(numbers)
        assert all(x <= y for x, y in zip(rescaled_numbers, numbers))

    return [property_1, property_2]
```
This test suite includes two property tests:

1. The first property test ensures that the output of the `rescale_to_unit` function is a list of numbers between 0 and 1.
2. The second property test ensures that the output of the `rescale_to_unit` function is sorted in ascending order.

You can use this test suite to test any future solution for the `rescale_to_unit` function, and it will ensure that the solution meets the desired properties.</s>

def rescale_to_unit(numbers: List[float]) -> List[float]:
    """ Given list of numbers (of at least two elements), apply a linear transform to that list,

    """
    smallest = min(numbers)
    largest = max(numbers)

```
This code defines a function `rescale_to_unit` that takes a list of numbers and returns a new list of numbers with the same shape, but where the smallest number in the original list is mapped to 0 and the largest number is mapped to 1. The function first finds the smallest and largest numbers in the list using the built-in `min` and `max` functions, and then uses a list comprehension to apply the linear transformation to each element of the list. The resulting list is returned.

Here's an explanation of how the linear transformation works:

* First, we find the smallest and largest numbers in the list. Let's call them `smallest` and `largest`, respectively.
* We subtract `smallest` from each number in the list to shift the range of the numbers so that the smallest number becomes 0. This gives us a list of numbers that all have a minimum value of 0.
* We divide each number in the list by `largest - smallest` to rescale the numbers to the range [0, 1]. This gives us a list of numbers that all have a minimum value of 0 and a maximum value of 1.

The test case `[1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0]` is used to demonstrate that the function works as expected. The expected output is `[0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0]`, which is the result of applying the linear transformation to the input list.</s>

This function takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list of numbers where each element is rescaled to the unit interval [0, 1] based on the minimum and maximum values in the original list.

Here's an explanation of how the function works:

1. First, we find the minimum and maximum values in the input list using the `min()` and `max()` functions.
2. Then, we use a list comprehension to iterate over the input list and calculate the rescaled value for each element. This is done by subtracting the minimum value from the element, dividing the result by the difference between the minimum and maximum values, and finally multiplying by 1 to convert the result to a float.
3. The resulting list of rescaled values is returned by the function.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```
numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0]
rescaled_numbers = rescale_to_unit(numbers)
print(rescaled_numbers)  # [0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0]

Note that this solution assumes that the input list contains at least two elements.

```
def rescale_to_unit(numbers: List[float]) -> List[float]:

    smallest = min(numbers)
    largest = max(numbers)

```
This test suite uses the `hypothesis.given` decorator to specify the input strategy for the `test_rescale_to_unit` function. The input strategy is a list of floats, with a minimum size of 2.

The test function itself asserts that the smallest number in the input list is transformed to 0.0, the largest number is transformed to 1.0, and all other numbers are transformed to values between 0.0 and 1.0, inclusive. It also asserts that the resulting list has the same length as the input list.

Note that this test suite does not test the edge case where the input list contains only two elements, as this is not a valid input for the `rescale_to_unit` function.</s>  Sure! Here's a test suite using the Hypothesis library to test the `rescale_to_unit` function:

This test suite tests the following properties of the `rescale_to_unit` function:

1. The smallest number in the input list becomes 0 in the output list.
2. The largest number in the input list becomes 1 in the output list.
3. The function is linear, meaning that the output values are proportional to the input values.

The test suite uses the `strategies.lists` strategy to generate lists of floats, and the `min_size` parameter is set to 2 to ensure that the input lists have at least two elements. The `property_test` function takes a list of floats as input and applies the `rescale_to_unit` function to it. The function then tests the three properties mentioned above using the `assert` statement.

Note that this test suite assumes that the `rescale_to_unit` function is implemented correctly and that the input list is valid. If the function is not implemented correctly or the input list is invalid, the test suite may produce false negatives or false positives.</s>  Sure! Here's a test suite using the `hypothesis` library to test the `rescale_to_unit` function:
```python
from hypothesis import given, strategies

def property_test(candidate_function) -> None:
    @given(strategies.lists(strategies.floats()))
    def property_1(numbers):
        assert len(numbers) >= 2

        largest = max(numbers)
        scaled_numbers = candidate_function(numbers)
        assert len(scaled_numbers) == len(numbers)
        for i, scaled_number in enumerate(scaled_numbers):
            assert scaled_number >= 0 and scaled_number <= 1
            if i == 0:
                assert scaled_number == 0
            elif i == len(numbers) - 1:
                assert scaled_number == 1
            else:
                assert scaled_number > 0 and scaled_number < 1

    @given(strategies.lists(strategies.floats()))

        for i, scaled_number in enumerate(scaled_numbers):

This test suite tests two properties of the `rescale_to_unit` function:

1. The function should return a list of the same length as the input list.
2. The smallest number in the input list should become 0, and the largest should become 1. All other numbers should be scaled proportionally.</s>

This code uses list comprehension to create a new list of the rescaled numbers. It first finds the minimum and maximum values in the input list using the `min` and `max` functions, and then uses these values to calculate the rescale factor for each number in the list. The rescale factor is the difference between the maximum and minimum values divided by the maximum value minus the minimum value. This factor is then used to rescale each number in the list by subtracting the minimum value and dividing by the rescale factor. The resulting list of rescaled numbers is returned.

This code passes the test case given in the problem statement, and also passes the following additional test cases:
```

This test suite generates a list of numbers using the `strategies.lists` and `strategies.floats` strategies, and then tests the `rescale_to_unit` function on this list. The test suite checks that the smallest number is transformed to 0, the largest number is transformed to 1, and that the difference between each adjacent pair of numbers is 0.25.

Note that this test suite only tests the properties of the `rescale_to_unit` function that are specified in the docstring of the function. If you want to test additional properties, you can add more tests to the `property_test` function.</s>

This function takes a list of numbers as input and applies a linear transformation to that list such that the smallest number becomes 0 and the largest number becomes 1. The function first finds the minimum and maximum values in the list using the `min()` and `max()` functions, respectively. Then, it uses list comprehension to create a new list where each element is transformed according to the formula `(x - minimum) / (maximum - minimum)`, where `x` is the original value of the element.

The `min()` and `max()` functions are used to find the minimum and maximum values in the list, respectively. The formula used to transform the elements is a linear transformation that maps the smallest value to 0 and the largest value to 1.

The function returns the transformed list.

Here is an example usage of the function:
```
numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0]
rescaled_numbers = rescale_to_unit(numbers)

1. The function returns a list of the correct length.
2. The function maps the smallest number to 0 and the largest number to 1, and all other numbers are rescaled accordingly.

The `property_1` test checks that the function returns the expected result for a specific input. The `property_2` test checks that the function maps the smallest and largest numbers correctly, and that all other numbers are rescaled accordingly.

The `strategies.lists` strategy is used to generate lists of floats with a minimum size of 2. The `strategies.floats` strategy is used to generate floats with `allow_infinity=False` and `allow_nan=False` to avoid generating special values.

The `given` decorator is used to define the test cases, and the `assert` statement is used to check the expected behavior of the function.</s>  ```

This function takes a list of floating-point numbers as input, and returns a new list of the same length, where each element is the result of applying a linear transformation to the corresponding element of the input list. The transformation is defined as follows:

* The smallest element of the input list is mapped to 0.
* The largest element of the input list is mapped to 1.
* All other elements are scaled linearly between 0 and 1.

The function uses the `min` and `max` functions to find the smallest and largest elements of the input list, and then uses list comprehension to apply the transformation to each element of the list.</s>

```python
from hypothesis import given, strategies

```
This test suite tests the `rescale_to_unit` function by checking that it returns a list of the same length as the input list, with the smallest element becoming 0 and the largest element becoming 1. It also checks that the output is a list of floats, all of which are non-negative and less than or equal to 1, and that the output list is sorted in ascending order.

Note that this test suite assumes that the `rescale_to_unit` function will be implemented using a linear transform, as described in the problem statement. If a different implementation is used, the test suite may need to be modified accordingly.</s>

This test suite uses two property tests to verify the correctness of the `rescale_to_unit` function:

1. The first property test checks that the length of the input list is preserved in the output list, and that all elements of the output list are between 0 and 1, and that the output list is sorted in ascending order.
2. The second property test checks that the first element of the output list is 0.0 and the last element is 1.0.

Note that this test suite assumes that the `rescale_to_unit` function takes a list of floats as input and returns a list of floats. If the function takes a different type of input or returns a different type of output, the test suite will need to be modified accordingly.</s>

This code defines a function `rescale_to_unit` that takes a list of floating-point numbers as input and returns a new list of floating-point numbers. The function applies a linear transform to the input list such that the smallest number in the list becomes 0 and the largest number becomes 1.

The function first finds the minimum and maximum values in the input list using the `min` and `max` functions, respectively. It then uses a list comprehension to create a new list of numbers, where each number is the result of subtracting the minimum value from the corresponding input number, and then dividing by the difference between the minimum and maximum values. This produces a list of numbers that are all between 0 and 1, inclusive.

The `rescale_to_unit` function is type-annotated with the `List[float]` type, which indicates that it expects a list of floating-point numbers as input and returns a list of floating-point numbers. The type annotation is used by type checkers and other tools to help catch type errors and improve code readability.</s>

  Sure, here is a test suite for the `rescale_to_unit` function using the `hypothesis` library:
```
from hypothesis import given, strategies

def property_test(candidate_function):
    @given(strategies.lists(strategies.floats(), min_size=2))
    def property_1(numbers):
        result = candidate_function(numbers)
        assert len(result) == len(numbers)
        assert all(0 <= x <= 1 for x in result)
        assert result[0] == 0
        assert result[-1] == 1

    @given(strategies.lists(strategies.floats(), min_size=2))
    def property_2(numbers):
        result = candidate_function(numbers)
        assert all(result[i] <= result[i+1] for i in range(len(result)-1))

    return [property_1, property_2]
```
This test suite checks two properties of the `rescale_to_unit` function:

1. The length of the input list and the output list should be the same.
2. The output list should contain only values between 0 and 1, and the first element should be 0, and the last element should be 1.
3. The output list should be sorted in ascending order.

The test suite uses the `hypothesis` library to generate random lists of floating-point numbers, and checks that the `rescale_to_unit` function satisfies the properties for all possible inputs.</s>  ```

    min_value = min(numbers)
    max_value = max(numbers)

```
This function first finds the minimum and maximum values in the input list using the `min` and `max` functions. It then uses list comprehension to create a new list where each element is the result of subtracting the minimum value from the original value and then dividing by the difference between the minimum and maximum values. This gives the desired rescaling of the input list to the unit interval.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```
numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0]
rescaled_numbers = rescale_to_unit(numbers)
print(rescaled_numbers)  # [0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0]

This code defines a function `rescale_to_unit` that takes a list of floating-point numbers as input and returns a new list of floating-point numbers that has been rescaled to the unit interval [0, 1]. The function works by first finding the minimum and maximum values in the input list, and then applying a linear transform to each element of the list to map the minimum value to 0 and the maximum value to 1. The resulting list is then returned.
