The function `property_test` takes a candidate function as input and returns a list of property tests. Each property test is a function decorated with `@given` from the `hypothesis` library.

The three property tests are:

1. `property_1`: checks that the factors are in non-descending order.
2. `property_2`: checks that no factor is equal to 1.
3. `property_3`: checks that no factor is equal to the original number.

The test suite is generated by running the `property_test` function on a hypothetical future solution to the problem of finding prime factors. The tests are run on a range of inputs, including small and large integers, to ensure that the solution is robust and works correctly for a wide range of inputs.</s>  ```

This code uses a simple algorithm to find the prime factors of a given integer. It starts with the smallest prime number (2) and repeatedly divides the input number by the prime number if it is divisible. It appends the prime number to the list of factors and updates the input number accordingly. Once the input number is reduced to 1, the list of factors is returned in the correct order from smallest to largest.</s>  ```

    factors = []

    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i:
            i += 1
        else:
            n //= i
            factors.append(i)
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)
    return factors
```
This code uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to find all prime factors of a given integer. The algorithm starts with the number 2 and repeatedly divides it by all the numbers less than or equal to the square root of the number. If a number is not divisible by any smaller number, it is prime and is added to the list of prime factors. The list is returned in the order from smallest to largest.

The code uses the ```//``` operator to perform integer division and the ```%``` operator to check if a number is divisible by another number. It also uses the ```append()``` method to add elements to a list.

Note that this code assumes that the input number is a positive integer. If the input number is negative, the code will produce incorrect results.</s>  ```
def prime_factors(n):
    factors = []
    i = 2
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i:
            i += 1
        else:
            n //= i
            factors.append(i)
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)
    return factors
```</s>  To solve this problem, we can use the `math.factorial` function from the `math` module in Python. The `math.factorial` function returns the factorial of a given number, which is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to that number.

Here is an example of how you can use the `math.factorial` function to find the prime factors of a given integer:
```
import math

def get_prime_factors(n):
    factors = []
    while n > 1:
        factor = math.factorial(n)
        if factor > 1:
            factors.append(factor)
            n //= factor
    return factors

print(get_prime_factors(120))  # Output: [2, 2, 3, 5]
print(get_prime_factors(100))  # Output: [2, 2, 5, 5]
```
In this code, the `get_prime_factors` function takes an integer `n` as input and returns a list of the prime factors of `n` in the order from smallest to largest. The function works by repeatedly dividing `n` by the next prime factor until `n` is equal to 1. The `math.factorial` function is used to compute the factorial of `n` and determine whether it is a prime factor.

Note that this function will only work for positive integers. If you need to find the prime factors of negative or complex numbers, you will need to use a different approach.</s>  To find the prime factors of a given integer, we can use the following code:
```
def prime_factors(n):
    factors = []
    i = 2
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i:
            i += 1
        else:
            n //= i
            factors.append(i)
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)
    return factors
```
This code uses a simple loop to iterate through the possible prime factors of the given integer. It starts by setting `i` to 2, the smallest prime number, and checks if `n` is divisible by `i`. If it is, the loop increments `i` and checks again. If `n` is not divisible by `i`, it sets `n` to the result of dividing `n` by `i` and appends `i` to the list of prime factors. Finally, if `n` is still greater than 1 after the loop, it is added to the list of prime factors.

Here's an example of how to use this function:
```
print(prime_factors(12))  # Output: [2, 2, 3]
print(prime_factors(15))  # Output: [3, 5]
print(prime_factors(24))  # Output: [2, 2, 2, 3]
```</s>  ```
def prime_factors(n):
    factors = []
    i = 2
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i:
            i += 1
        else:
            n //= i
            factors.append(i)
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)
    return factors
```
Explanation:

The above code uses a simple iterative approach to find the prime factors of a given integer. We start with the smallest prime number `i = 2` and check if it divides the input number `n`. If it does, we divide `n` by the prime factor and add it to the list of factors. We repeat this process until all prime factors are found. Finally, we return the list of factors in the order from smallest to largest.</s>  ```
def prime_factors(n):
    factors = []
    i = 2
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i:
            i += 1
        else:
            n //= i
            factors.append(i)
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)
    return factors
```</s>  ```

    factors = []
    i = 2
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i:
            i += 1
        else:
            n //= i
            factors.append(i)
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)
    return factors
```
Explanation:
The above code uses a simple iterative approach to find the prime factors of a given integer. It starts with the value 2 and checks if it divides the input number. If it does, it divides the number and appends the prime factor to the list. It continues this process until the input number is reduced to 1, at which point the list of prime factors is returned. The code uses the modulo operator (%) to check if a number is divisible by another number, and the floor division operator (//) to divide two numbers without producing a floating point result.</s>
