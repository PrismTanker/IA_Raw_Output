```
This test suite uses the `hypothesis` library to generate integers as inputs to the `candidate_function` and checks that the prime factorization is correct.

The first property, `property_1`, checks that the prime factorization is correct by asserting that all factors of `n` are in the returned list. It also checks that the list is unique.

The second property, `property_2`, checks that the prime factorization is correct by asserting that all factors of `n` are in the returned list, and that all non-prime factors of `n` are not in the returned list.

The test suite returns a list containing the two properties.</s>  ```

This function takes an integer `n` as input and returns a list of its prime factors. The prime factors are calculated using the following steps:

1. If `n` is 1, return [1].
2. Loop through all integers `i` from 2 to the square root of `n`.
3. If `n` is divisible by `i`, append `i` to the list of factors and recursively call the function with `n // i` as input.
4. If no factor is found, append `n` to the list of factors.
5. Return the list of factors.

This function uses the `math` module to calculate the square root of `n`.

Here is an example of how to use the function:
```
print(get_prime_factorization(12))  # Output: [2, 2, 3]
print(get_prime_factorization(100))  # Output: [2, 2, 5, 5]
```
This function is able to find the prime factorization of any positive integer `n`.</s>  ```
def prime_factorization(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return []
    factors = []
    while n % 2 == 0:
        factors.append(2)
        n //= 2
    for i in range(3, int(n ** 0.5) + 1, 2):
        while n % i == 0:
            factors.append(i)
            n //= i
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)
    return factors
```
This code uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to find the prime factors of a given integer. It starts by dividing the input number by 2 and repeatedly dividing by 2 until it is not divisible by 2. Then, it iterates over the odd numbers from 3 to the square root of the input number, and repeatedly divides the input number by each odd number until it is not divisible by that number. Finally, if the input number is greater than 1, it is added to the list of prime factors.

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n log log n), where n is the input number. The space complexity is O(log n) because the list of prime factors can have at most log n elements.

Here are some examples of how this code can be used:
```
>>> prime_factorization(1)
[]
>>> prime_factorization(2)
[2]
>>> prime_factorization(3)
[3]
>>> prime_factorization(6)
[2, 3]
>>> prime_factorization(12)
[2, 2, 3]
>>> prime_factorization(24)
[2, 2, 2, 3]
```</s>  ```
def prime_factorization(n):
    factors = []
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        while n % i == 0:
            factors.append(i)
            n //= i
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)
    return factors
```
This code uses a simple trial division approach to find the prime factors of a given integer `n`. It starts by iterating from 2 to the square root of `n` and divides `n` by each number to see if it is a factor. If it is, the factor is added to the list of factors and `n` is updated. The loop continues until `n` is 1, at which point the list of factors is returned.

For example, if `n` is 12, the code will return `[2, 2, 3]`. If `n` is 100, the code will return `[2, 2, 5, 5]`.

Note that this code assumes that the input `n` is a positive integer. If `n` is 0 or negative, the code will return an empty list.

Also, this code does not handle the case where `n` is a perfect square, such as 9 or 25. In such cases, the code will return a list with only one element, which is the square root of `n`. For example, if `n` is 9, the code will return `[3]`. If `n` is 25, the code will return `[5]`.

This code can be optimized for performance by using a more efficient algorithm, such as the Sieve of Eratosthenes, to find prime factors. However, the above code is a simple and intuitive implementation that is easy to understand and modify.</s>  ```

def prime_factorization(n):
    factors = []
    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        while n % i == 0:

    if n > 1:

```
This function takes an integer `n` as input and returns its prime factorization as a list of prime numbers. The function first checks if `n` is divisible by 2, and if so, it adds 2 to the list of factors and divides `n` by 2. It then checks if `n` is divisible by 3, and if so, it adds 3 to the list of factors and divides `n` by 3. It continues this process until `n` is no longer divisible by any prime number less than or equal to its square root. Finally, if `n` is still not 1, it adds `n` to the list of factors.

Here are some test cases to demonstrate how the function works:
```
print(prime_factorization(1))  # [1]
print(prime_factorization(2))  # [2]
print(prime_factorization(3))  # [3]
print(prime_factorization(4))  # [2, 2]
print(prime_factorization(5))  # [5]
print(prime_factorization(6))  # [2, 3]
print(prime_factorization(7))  # [7]
print(prime_factorization(8))  # [2, 2, 2]
print(prime_factorization(9))  # [3, 3]
print(prime_factorization(10))  # [2, 5]
print(prime_factorization(11))  # [11]
print(prime_factorization(12))  # [2, 2, 3]
print(prime_factorization(13))  # [13]
print(prime_factorization(14))  # [2, 7]
print(prime_factorization(15))  # [3, 5]
print(prime_factorization(16))  # [2, 2, 2, 2]
print(prime_factorization(17))  # [17]
print(prime_factorization(18))  # [2, 3, 3]
print(prime_factorization(19))  # [19]
print(prime_factorization(20))  # [2, 2, 5]
```
These test cases cover a range of inputs, including prime numbers, composite numbers with a single prime factor, and composite numbers with multiple prime factors. The function correctly returns the prime factorization of each input.</s>  ```

This code uses the prime factorization algorithm to find the prime factors of a given integer. The algorithm starts by checking if the number is 1, in which case it returns [1]. Otherwise, it iterates over the numbers from 2 to the square root of the number, and checks if the number is divisible by each of them. If it is, it appends the factor to a list and recursively calls the function with the quotient. If no factor is found, it appends the number itself to the list. Finally, it returns the list of prime factors.

Here are some test cases:
```
print(prime_factorization(1))  # [1]
print(prime_factorization(2))  # [2]
print(prime_factorization(3))  # [3]
print(prime_factorization(4))  # [2, 2]

This code uses the math module to calculate the square root of the given integer, and the while loop to iterate through the potential factors of the integer. The if statements are used to check if the number is a prime factor, and if it is, it is added to the list of factors. The final else statement is used to check if the number is not a factor, and if it is not, the loop continues. The final return statement returns the list of factors.</s>  ```

This function takes an integer `n` and returns a list of its prime factors. The function first checks if `n` is less than or equal to 1, in which case it returns an empty list. Then, it iterates over the integers from 2 to the square root of `n` and checks if `n` is divisible by each of them. If it is, it appends the factor to the list and divides `n` by it. Finally, if `n` is greater than 1 after the loop, it appends `n` to the list and returns it.

Note that the function assumes that the input integer is positive. If you want to handle negative integers as well, you can add a check for that at the beginning of the function.</s>  ```

This function takes an integer `n` as input and returns its prime factorization as a list of prime numbers. The algorithm works as follows:

1. Start with the initial value of `n` and repeatedly divide it by 2 until it is not even.
2. Start with the initial value of `n` and repeatedly divide it by 3 until it is not divisible by 3.
3. Repeat steps 2 and 3 with increasing values of `i` until `n` is 1.
4. If `n` is greater than 2 after the loop, then it is prime, and we add it to the list of factors.

For example, if we call `prime_factorization(12)`, the function will return `[2, 2, 3]`.

Note that this function assumes that the input is a positive integer. If the input is not a positive integer, it will raise a `ValueError`.</s>  ```
def prime_factorization(n):
    factors = []
    i = 2
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i:
            i += 1
        else:
            n //= i
            factors.append(i)
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)
    return factors
```
This function uses the trial division method to find the prime factors of an integer `n`. It starts by iterating from 2 to the square root of `n`, and checks if `n` is divisible by each integer in the range. If it is, it updates `n` to be the quotient of `n` divided by that integer, and adds that integer to the list of factors. It then repeats this process until `n` is 1, and returns the list of prime factors.

Note that this function only returns the prime factors of `n`, and does not return the prime factorization in the form of a string or other representation. If you need to return the prime factorization in a specific format, you can modify the function accordingly.</s>  ```
def prime_factorization(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return []
    factors = []
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            factors.append(i)
            factors.extend(prime_factorization(n // i))
            break
    else:
        factors.append(n)
    return factors
```
This function takes an integer `n` as input and returns a list of its prime factors in ascending order. It uses the trial division method to find the prime factors, which is an efficient algorithm for finding the prime factors of a number.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```
n = 12
print(prime_factorization(n))  # Output: [2, 2, 3]
```
Note that this function only works for positive integers. If the input is a negative integer, it will not work properly.</s>
