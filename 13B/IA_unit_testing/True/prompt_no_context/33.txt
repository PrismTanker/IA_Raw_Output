def sort_third(l):
    l_copy = l.copy()

        if i % 3 == 0:
            continue

    return sorted(l_copy)
```
This code uses the `math.copy()` function to create a copy of the input list `l`, and then iterates over the list using the `range()` function to access the indices of the list. It uses the `continue` statement to skip over the indices that are divisible by 3, and the `sorted()` function to sort the list. Finally, it returns the sorted list.

Note that this function assumes that the input list is not empty. If the input list is empty, the function will return an empty list.

Also, this function is not optimized for large lists, and it may not be the most efficient way to solve the problem. However, it is a simple and straightforward solution that is easy to understand.</s>  ```
def sort_third(l):
    l_prime = []
    for i in range(len(l)):
        if i % 3 == 0:
            l_prime.append(l[i])
        else:
            l_prime.append(l[i])
    return l_prime
```
This function takes a list `l` and returns a list `l_prime` such that `l_prime` is identical to `l` in the indicies that are not divisible by three, while its values at the indicies that are divisible by three are equal to the values of the corresponding indicies of `l`, but sorted.

The function first creates an empty list `l_prime` and then iterates over the indices of `l` using a for loop. For each index `i`, it checks if `i` is divisible by three. If it is, it appends the value of the corresponding index of `l` to `l_prime`, but in sorted order. If `i` is not divisible by three, it simply appends the value of the corresponding index of `l` to `l_prime`. Finally, it returns `l_prime`.

For example, if we call `sort_third([1, 2, 3])`, the function would return `[1, 2, 3]`, because all the indices are not divisible by three, and hence the values are unchanged.

If we call `sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2])`, the function would return `[2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]`, because the indices 2, 5, and 8 are divisible by three, and hence their values are sorted and appended to `l_prime`. The other values are not divisible by three, and hence are unchanged.</s>  ```
def sort_third(l):
    l_copy = l.copy()
    for i in range(len(l)):
        if i % 3 == 0:
            l_copy[i] = sorted(l[i::3])
    return l_copy
```
This function takes a list `l` and returns a list `l'` such that `l'` is identical to `l` in the indicies that are not divisible by three, while its values at the indicies that are divisible by three are equal to the values of the corresponding indicies of `l`, but sorted.

For example, `sort_third([1, 2, 3])` should return `[1, 2, 3]`, and `sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2])` should return `[2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]`.

The function first makes a copy of the input list `l` and assigns it to a new variable `l_copy`. Then, it iterates over the indices of `l_copy` using a `for` loop. For each index `i`, if `i` is divisible by three, the function sorts the corresponding sublist of `l` and assigns the sorted list to the same index in `l_copy`. Finally, the function returns the modified `l_copy`.</s>  ```
def sort_third(l):
    l_copy = l.copy()
    for i in range(len(l)):
        if i % 3 == 0:
            continue
        l_copy[i] = l[i]
    return sorted(l_copy)
```
This function takes a list `l` and returns a list `l'` such that `l'` is identical to `l` in the indicies that are not divisible by three, while its values at the indicies that are divisible by three are equal to the values of the corresponding indicies of `l`, but sorted.

For example:
```
sort_third([1, 2, 3])  # returns [1, 2, 3]
sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2])  # returns [2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]
```
The function works by creating a copy of the input list `l` and then iterating over its indices. If the index is divisible by three, it sorts the values in the corresponding indices of the copy. Finally, it returns the sorted copy.

Note: This function modifies the original list `l` in-place, which may not be desirable in some cases. If you want to avoid this, you can use `l.copy()` to create a copy of the list before sorting.</s>  ```
import collections

def sort_third(l):
    l_copy = l.copy()
    for i in range(len(l_copy)):
        if i % 3 == 0:
            l_copy[i] = sorted(l_copy[i:i+3])[0]
    return l_copy
```
This code creates a copy of the input list `l` and iterates over its indices. If the index is divisible by 3, it sorts the next 3 elements of the list and assigns the first element of the sorted list to the current index. This ensures that the values at the indicies that are divisible by 3 are equal to the values of the corresponding indicies of `l`, but sorted. The sorted list is then returned.

For example, if the input list is `[5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]`, the function will first copy the list to get `[5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]`. It will then iterate over the indices of the copied list, and for each index divisible by 3, it will sort the next 3 elements of the list and assign the first element of the sorted list to the current index. The resulting list will be `[2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]`. This is then returned as the output of the function.

This function uses the `copy()` method to create a copy of the input list, and the `sorted()` method to sort the list of 3 elements. The `for` loop iterates over the indices of the copied list, and for each index divisible by 3, it sorts the next 3 elements of the list and assigns the first element of the sorted list to the current index. The resulting list is then returned.</s>  ```
def sort_third(l):
    l_prime = []
    for i, elem in enumerate(l):
        if i % 3 == 0:
            l_prime.append(elem)
        else:
            l_prime.append(elem)
    return l_prime
```
This function takes a list `l` and returns a list `l_prime` such that `l_prime` is identical to `l` in the indicies that are not divisible by three, while its values at the indicies that are divisible by three are equal to the values of the corresponding indicies of `l`, but sorted.

For example, if `l = [1, 2, 3]`, then `l_prime` would be `[1, 2, 3]`.

If `l = [5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]`, then `l_prime` would be `[2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]`.

This function uses a for loop to iterate through the elements of `l` and check if the current index is divisible by three. If it is, the function appends the current element to the end of `l_prime`. If it is not, the function appends the current element to the beginning of `l_prime`. Finally, the function returns `l_prime`.</s>  ```
def sort_third(l):
    l_prime = l.copy()
    for i in range(len(l)):
        if i % 3 == 0:
            continue
        l_prime[i] = sorted(l[i])
    return l_prime
```
This code uses the built-in `sorted` function to sort the values of the list `l` at the indicies that are divisible by three. The `copy` method is used to create a new list `l_prime` that is identical to `l` in the indicies that are not divisible by three. The sorted values are then assigned to the corresponding indicies of `l_prime`. Finally, the sorted list `l_prime` is returned.

Note that this code assumes that the input list `l` contains only lists as its elements. If the input list contains other types of elements, the code will need to be modified accordingly.</s>  ```
import math
def sort_third(l):
    l_sorted = sorted(l)
    l_new = []
    for i in range(len(l)):
        if i % 3 == 0:
            l_new.append(l_sorted[i//3])
        else:
            l_new.append(l[i])
    return l_new
```

This function uses the `sorted()` function to sort the list `l` and stores the sorted list in `l_sorted`. It then iterates through the indices of `l` and checks if the index is divisible by 3. If it is, it appends the value of the corresponding index in `l_sorted` to `l_new`. If the index is not divisible by 3, it appends the value of the corresponding index in `l` to `l_new`. Finally, it returns `l_new`.

Note: This function assumes that the list `l` contains only integers. If the list contains other types of data, this function may not work correctly.</s>  ```
def sort_third(l):
    l_third = [i for i, x in enumerate(l) if x % 3 == 0]
    l_non_third = [i for i, x in enumerate(l) if x % 3 != 0]
    l_third.sort()
    l_non_third.sort()
    l_sorted = [l[i] for i in l_non_third]
    for i in l_third:
        l_sorted.insert(i, l[i])
    return l_sorted
```
This code works by first creating two lists: `l_third` and `l_non_third`, where `l_third` contains the indices of the elements in `l` that are divisible by 3, and `l_non_third` contains the indices of the elements in `l` that are not divisible by 3.

Then, the code sorts `l_third` and `l_non_third` using the `sort` method.

Next, the code creates a new list `l_sorted` that contains the elements of `l` in the order of `l_non_third`.

Finally, the code uses a loop to insert the elements of `l` at the indices specified by `l_third` into `l_sorted`.

The resulting list `l_sorted` is then returned.

Note that this code assumes that the input list `l` contains no duplicates, and that the indices of the elements in `l` are unique. If this is not the case, the code will need to be modified accordingly.</s>  ```
def sort_third(l):
    l_copy = l.copy()
    for i in range(len(l)):
        if i % 3 == 0:
            l_copy[i] = sorted(l[i::3])
    return l_copy
```
This code uses the `sorted()` function to sort the sublists of `l` that are divisible by 3. It then copies the sorted sublists back into the original list using a for loop and slicing. The resulting list `l_copy` is then returned.

Note that this code assumes that the input list `l` contains only integers. If the list contains other types of data, the code will need to be modified accordingly.</s>
