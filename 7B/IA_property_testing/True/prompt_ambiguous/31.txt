from hypothesis import given, strategies

def property_test(candidate_function):
    @given(strategies.integers())
    def property_1(n):
        assert candidate_function(n) == (n > 1)

    @given(strategies.integers())
    def property_2(n):
        assert candidate_function(n) == (n % 2 == 0)

    return [property_1, property_2]
```
This test suite generates two property tests for the `candidate_function` that takes an integer as input. The first property test checks if the function returns `True` for all prime numbers and `False` for all composite numbers. The second property test checks if the function returns `True` for all even numbers and `False` for all odd numbers.</s>  Here is a Python function that returns True if a number is prime and False otherwise:
```
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```
This function uses a simple brute force approach to check if a number is prime. It iterates from 2 to the square root of the number and checks if the number is divisible by any of the numbers in the range. If the number is not divisible by any of the numbers in the range, it must be prime.

For example, if we call the function with the number 17, it will return True, because 17 is prime. If we call the function with the number 4, it will return False, because 4 is not prime.

Note that this function uses the `range` function to generate a range of numbers from 2 to the square root of the number. This is more efficient than using a `for` loop to iterate over the numbers in the range. Additionally, this function uses the `int` function to convert the square root of the number to an integer, which is necessary because the square root of a number may not be an integer.</s>  ```
def is_prime(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```
Explanation:

The function `is_prime` takes a single argument `n`, which is the number to be checked for primality.

The function first checks if `n` is less than or equal to 1. If it is, it returns `False`, indicating that `n` is not prime.

Next, the function uses a loop to check if `n` is divisible by any number between 2 and the square root of `n`. If any such number is found, the function returns `False`, indicating that `n` is not prime.

If the loop completes without finding any divisors, the function returns `True`, indicating that `n` is prime.

Note that the function uses the `range` function to generate a sequence of numbers between 2 and the square root of `n`. The `int` function is used to convert the square root of `n` to an integer, so that the loop can terminate when the square root of `n` is reached.

This implementation is efficient and works well for large numbers. However, it is not the only way to solve the problem, and there are other approaches that may be more suitable depending on the specific requirements of the problem.</s>  Here is a function that determines if a number is prime:
```
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```
This function uses a loop to check if any number between 2 and the square root of n (inclusive) divides n evenly. If such a number is found, the number is not prime and the function returns False. If no such number is found, the number is prime and the function returns True.

You can also use the `math.sqrt` function from the `math` module to calculate the square root of `n`:
```
from math import sqrt

def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```
This code is more concise and efficient, but it requires importing the `math` module.</s>  ```
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```
Explanation:

This function uses a simple algorithm to determine if a number is prime. It starts by checking if the number is less than 2, and if it is, it immediately returns False.

Next, it iterates from 2 to the square root of the number, and checks if the number is divisible by any of the numbers in the range. If it is, it returns False.

If the number is not divisible by any of the numbers in the range, it returns True.

For example, if the input is 17, the function will return True because 17 is not divisible by any number in the range of 2 to 4, and it is not divisible by 1.

If the input is 4, the function will return False because 4 is divisible by 2.

If the input is 5, the function will return True because 5 is not divisible by any number in the range of 2 to 2.5, and it is not divisible by 1.

This function uses the built-in math.sqrt() function to calculate the square root of the number, which is much faster than using a loop to calculate the square root.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.</s>  To determine if a number is prime, we can use the following function:
```
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```
This function first checks if the number is less than 2. If it is, it returns False. Otherwise, it iterates through the numbers from 2 to the square root of the number and checks if the number is divisible by any of them. If it is, it returns False. Otherwise, it returns True.

Here is a test case to check if the function works correctly:
```
print(is_prime(1)) # should print False
print(is_prime(2)) # should print True
print(is_prime(3)) # should print True
print(is_prime(4)) # should print False
print(is_prime(5)) # should print True
print(is_prime(6)) # should print False
print(is_prime(7)) # should print True
print(is_prime(8)) # should print False
print(is_prime(9)) # should print False
print(is_prime(10)) # should print False
```</s>  ```
def is_prime(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```
This code uses a simple loop to check if a number is prime. It starts by checking if the number is less than or equal to 1, and if it is, it returns False. Otherwise, it loops through all the numbers from 2 to the square root of the number, checking if any of them divide the number without a remainder. If any such number is found, the function returns False, indicating that the number is not prime. If the loop completes without finding any such number, the function returns True, indicating that the number is prime.</s>  ```
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```</s>  ```
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```
Explanation:

The function `is_prime` takes a single argument `n`, which is the number to be checked for primality. It returns `True` if the number is prime, and `False` otherwise.

The function uses a simple algorithm to determine if a number is prime. It checks if the number is less than 2, and if it is, it returns `False`. If the number is greater than or equal to 2, it checks if it is divisible by any number between 2 and the square root of the number, inclusive. If the number is divisible by any number between 2 and the square root of the number, it is not prime, and the function returns `False`. Otherwise, the function returns `True`.

The function uses the `range` function to generate a list of numbers between 2 and the square root of the number. It then uses a `for` loop to iterate over the list and check if the number is divisible by any of the numbers in the list. If the number is divisible by any number, the function returns `False`. If the number is not divisible by any number, the function returns `True`.

The function uses the `int` function to convert the square root of the number to an integer. This is because the square root of a number may not be an integer, and the `range` function only accepts integer values.

The function uses the `**` operator to calculate the square root of the number. This is because the square root of a number is calculated by taking the square root of the number.

For example, if the number is 10, the function will check if 10 is divisible by any number between 2 and 3.16227766016 (which is the square root of 10). If 10 is divisible by any number between 2 and 3.16227766016, the function will return `False`. Otherwise, the function will return `True`.</s>  ```
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```
This code uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to determine if a number is prime. It starts by checking if the number is less than 2, and if it is not, it checks if any of the numbers between 2 and the square root of the number are divisible by it. If any of these numbers are divisible, the number is not prime, and the function returns False. If none of the numbers are divisible, the number is prime, and the function returns True.

Note that this code uses the math module to calculate the square root of the number, so you will need to import the math module at the top of your code file.

Also, this code assumes that the input number is a positive integer. If the input number can be negative or a floating-point number, you will need to modify the code to handle those cases.</s>
