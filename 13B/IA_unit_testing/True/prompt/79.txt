def decimal_to_binary(decimal):
    """You will be given a number in decimal form and your task is to convert it to
    binary format. The function should return a string, with each character representing a binary
    number. Each character in the string will be '0' or '1'.

    There will be an extra couple of characters 'db' at the beginning and at the end of the string.
    The extra characters are there to help with the format.

    Examples:

def decimal_to_binary(decimal):
    return "db" + bin(decimal)[2:] + "db"
```
This code works by first converting the decimal number to binary using the `bin()` function. The `[2:]` slice is used to remove the "0b" prefix from the binary string, and the "db" characters are added to the beginning and end of the string to meet the requirements. The resulting binary string is then returned.

Note that the `bin()` function returns a string in the format "0bxxxx", where xxxx is the binary representation of the number. The `[2:]` slice is used to remove the "0b" prefix from the string, leaving just the binary representation.</s>  ```
def decimal_to_binary(decimal):
    return "db" + bin(decimal)[2:] + "db"
```

This code uses the built-in `bin()` function to convert the decimal number to binary. The `[2:]` syntax is used to remove the leading "0b" prefix that `bin()` adds, and the `db` characters are added to the beginning and end of the string to match the expected format.</s>  ```
def decimal_to_binary(decimal):
    binary = bin(decimal)[2:]
    return "db" + binary + "db"
```
This code uses the built-in `bin()` function to convert the decimal number to a binary string, and then adds the extra characters "db" to the beginning and end of the string.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```
>>> decimal_to_binary(15)
'db1111db'
```
This function should pass all the test cases you provided.</s>  ```
def decimal_to_binary(decimal):
    binary = bin(decimal)[2:]
    return "db" + binary + "db"
```

This code uses the built-in `bin()` function to convert the decimal number to binary, and then adds the extra characters 'db' at the beginning and end of the string.

Note: The `[2:]` is used to remove the leading '0b' from the result of `bin()` function.

Also, note that the `bin()` function returns a string, and the `+` operator is used to concatenate the strings.

You can test this function as follows:
```
print(decimal_to_binary(15))  # prints "db1111db"
print(decimal_to_binary(32))  # prints "db100000db"
```</s>  ```
def decimal_to_binary(decimal):
    return "db" + bin(decimal)[2:] + "db"
```

This code uses the `bin()` function to convert the decimal number to binary format, and then adds the extra characters 'db' at the beginning and end of the string.

The `bin()` function returns a string with '0b' at the beginning, so we remove it by slicing the string starting from the second character.

def decimal_to_binary(decimal):
    return "db" + bin(decimal)[2:] + "db"
```

This function uses the `bin()` function to convert the decimal number to its binary representation. The `[2:]` is used to remove the "0b" prefix from the binary representation. The "db" characters are then added to the beginning and end of the string to match the expected format.

The `bin()` function is a built-in Python function that converts a number to its binary representation. For example, `bin(15)` returns the string "0b1111". The `[2:]` is used to remove the "0b" prefix from the binary representation.

This function returns a string, with each character representing a binary number. The "db" characters are there to help with the format.

For example, `decimal_to_binary(15)` returns the string "db1111db", which is the binary representation of 15 with the "db" characters at the beginning and end.

This function passes the given test cases.

Here are some test cases to demonstrate the function's behavior:
```
>>> decimal_to_binary(15)
'db1111db'
>>> decimal_to_binary(32)
'db100000db'
>>> decimal_to_binary(64)
'db1000000db'
>>> decimal_to_binary(128)
'db10000000db'
```</s>  ```
def decimal_to_binary(decimal):
    binary = bin(decimal)[2:]
    return "db" + binary + "db"
```
This code uses the built-in `bin()` function to convert the decimal number to binary, and then adds the extra characters 'db' at the beginning and end of the string. The `[2:]` slice is used to remove the '0b' prefix that is added by the `bin()` function.

This code passes the given test cases:
```
assert decimal_to_binary(15) == "db1111db"
assert decimal_to_binary(32) == "db100000db"
```</s>  ```
def decimal_to_binary(decimal):
    return "db" + bin(decimal)[2:] + "db"
```
This code uses the built-in `bin()` function to convert the decimal number to binary format, and then adds the extra "db" characters at the beginning and end of the string to match the required format.

Note that the `[2:]` part of the `bin()` function call is used to remove the leading "0b" characters from the binary representation, which are not needed for this problem.</s>  ```
import binascii

def decimal_to_binary(decimal):
    binary = bin(decimal)[2:]
    return "db" + binary + "db"
 ```</s>  ```
import math

def decimal_to_binary(decimal):
    binary = bin(decimal)[2:]
    return "db" + binary + "db"
```

This function uses the built-in `bin()` function to convert the decimal number to binary, and then adds the extra characters 'db' at the beginning and end of the string. The `[2:]` slicing is used to remove the '0b' prefix that is added by the `bin()` function.

Here are some test cases to demonstrate the function's output:
```
print(decimal_to_binary(15))   # db1111db
print(decimal_to_binary(32))   # db100000db
print(decimal_to_binary(128))  # db10000000db
print(decimal_to_binary(255))  # db11111111db
```
Note that the `bin()` function returns a string with the binary representation of the decimal number, so the function simply adds the 'db' characters at the beginning and end of the string to get the desired output format.</s>
