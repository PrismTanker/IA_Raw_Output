Prompt: You'll be given a string of words, and your task is to count the number
    of boredoms. A boredom is a sentence that starts with "I".
-------------------
  Here is a test suite for the problem:
```
{
    "test_count_boredom": {
        "in": {
            "string": "I am feeling bored. I am going to the movies."
        },
        "out": 2
    },
    "test_count_boredom_with_punctuation": {
        "in": {
            "string": "I am feeling bored! I am going to the movies."
        },
        "out": 2
    },
    "test_count_boredom_with_whitespace": {
        "in": {
            "string": "I am feeling bored. I am going to the movies."
        },
        "out": 2
    },
    "test_count_boredom_with_newlines": {
        "in": {
            "string": "I am feeling bored.\nI am going to the movies."
        },
        "out": 2
    },
    "test_count_boredom_with_multiple_sentences": {
        "in": {
            "string": "I am feeling bored. I am going to the movies. I am also feeling bored."
        },
        "out": 3
    },
    "test_count_boredom_with_no_boredom": {
        "in": {
            "string": "I am not feeling bored. I am going to the movies."
        },
        "out": 0
    },
    "test_count_boredom_with_empty_string": {
        "in": {
            "string": ""
        },
        "out": 0
    }
}
```
This test suite covers a variety of test cases, including:

* Testing the count with a simple string
* Testing the count with punctuation
* Testing the count with whitespace
* Testing the count with newlines
* Testing the count with multiple sentences
* Testing the count with no boredom
* Testing the count with an empty string

This test suite should be sufficient to test the functionality of the solution to the problem.</s>  ```
def count_boredom(sentence):
    count = 0
    for word in sentence.split():
        if word.startswith("I"):
            count += 1
    return count
```</s>  ```
import re

def count_boredom(text):
    return len(re.findall(r"^I\b", text, re.IGNORECASE))
```
This code uses the `re` module to count the number of sentences that start with "I" in the given text. The `re.findall` function returns a list of all the matches in the text, and the `len` function counts the number of items in the list. The `^` character in the regular expression matches the beginning of a string, and the `\b` character matches a word boundary, so only sentences that start with "I" and are not part of a larger word will be counted. The `re.IGNORECASE` flag makes the search case-insensitive.</s>  
```
def count_boredom(string):
    return len([word for word in string.split() if word.startswith("I")])
```
This code defines a function `count_boredom` that takes a string as input and returns the number of boredoms in the string. The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the words in the string, and checks if each word starts with "I" using the `startswith` method. If the word starts with "I", it is added to the list. The length of the list is returned as the number of boredoms.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```
string = "I am feeling bored. I am feeling bored. I am feeling bored."
print(count_boredom(string)) # Output: 3
```</s>  ```
import re

def count_boredom(text):
    return len(re.findall(r"^I ", text, flags=re.MULTILINE))
```
This code uses the `re` module to count the number of sentences that start with "I" in the given text. The `re.findall` function is used to find all the matches of the regular expression `r"^I "` in the text, where `^` matches the start of a line and `I ` matches the string "I" followed by a space. The `re.MULTILINE` flag is used to make the `^` match the start of any line, not just the start of the input string. Finally, the length of the list of matches is returned, which is the number of boredoms in the text.</s>  
```
import re

def count_boredom(sentence):
    return len(re.findall(r"^I", sentence))
```</s>  ```
def count_boredom(sentence):
    return sentence.count("I")
```
This code defines a function called `count_boredom` that takes a string as input and returns the number of boredoms in the string. The function uses the `count` method of the string to count the number of occurrences of the letter "I", which is the starting letter of a boredom.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```
sentence = "I am bored. I am bored. I am bored."
print(count_boredom(sentence))  # Output: 3
```
This code will output 3, which is the number of boredoms in the sentence.</s>  ```
import re

def count_boredoms(string):
    return len(re.findall(r'^I\b', string, re.IGNORECASE))
```
Explanation:

* `re.findall` is used to find all occurrences of the pattern in the string.
* `^I\b` is the regular expression pattern that matches any sentence that starts with "I" (case-insensitive). The `\b` is a word boundary that ensures that the match is not a substring of a larger word.
* `re.IGNORECASE` is used to make the match case-insensitive.
* The length of the list returned by `re.findall` is the number of boredoms in the string.</s>  ```
def count_boredom(text):
    return sum(1 for word in text.split() if word.startswith("I"))
```
This code uses the `split()` method to split the input string into a list of words, and then uses a generator expression to count the number of words that start with "I". The `sum()` function is used to sum up the results of the generator expression.

Here's an example of how this function would work:
```
text = "I am feeling bored. I am tired. I am hungry."
print(count_boredom(text)) # Output: 3
```
This code will output 3, because there are three sentences that start with "I" in the input string.</s>  ```
def count_boredom(sentence):
    count = 0
    for word in sentence.split():
        if word.startswith("I"):
            count += 1
    return count
```
You can test this function with the following code:
```
sentence = "I am bored. I am bored. I am bored."
print(count_boredom(sentence)) # Output: 3
```</s>  ```
def count_boredom(sentence):
    count = 0
    for word in sentence.split():
        if word.startswith("I"):
            count += 1
    return count
```

Example usage:
```
sentence = "I am bored. I am bored. I am bored."
print(count_boredom(sentence)) # Output: 3
```</s>
