Prompt: Check if a given number can be divided by 3 prime numbers.
-------------------
  Sure! Here's a test suite for a hypothetical solution to the "divisible by 3 prime numbers" problem using the Hypothesis library:
```
from hypothesis import given, strategies

def property_test(candidate_function) -> None:
    @given(strategies.integers())
    def property_1(x):
        assert candidate_function(x) in [1, 3, 9]

    @given(strategies.integers())
    def property_2(x):
        assert candidate_function(x) not in [2, 4, 6, 8]

    return [property_1, property_2]
```
This test suite defines two properties:

1. The given number should be divisible by 1, 3, or 9.
2. The given number should not be divisible by 2, 4, 6, or 8.

These properties are implemented as two separate test functions, `property_1` and `property_2`, which are decorated with the `@given` decorator from Hypothesis. The `given` decorator generates random inputs for the test functions based on the specified strategy. In this case, we're using the `strategies.integers()` strategy to generate random integers for the test functions.

The `property_1` test function checks that the given number is divisible by 1, 3, or 9, while the `property_2` test function checks that the given number is not divisible by 2, 4, 6, or 8.

Note that this test suite only tests the properties of the given number, and does not perform any actual division operations. It is up to the hypothetical solution to actually implement the logic for determining whether a given number is divisible by 3 prime numbers.</s>  ```
def is_divisible_by_3_primes(n):
    primes = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29]
    for p in primes:
        if n % p == 0:
            return True
    return False
```</s>  ```
def is_divisible_by_3_numbers(n):
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        for j in range(i+1, n+1):
            if n % i == 0 and n % j == 0:
                return True
    return False
```
This function takes an integer `n` as input and checks if it can be divided by 3 prime numbers. The function first iterates over the range of numbers from 1 to `n+1` and for each number `i`, it checks if `n` is divisible by `i` and `j` where `j` is the next number after `i`. If `n` is divisible by both `i` and `j`, the function returns `True`. If the loop completes without finding any such numbers, the function returns `False`.

Here are some examples:
```
>>> is_divisible_by_3_numbers(12)
True
>>> is_divisible_by_3_numbers(15)
True
>>> is_divisible_by_3_numbers(18)
False
>>> is_divisible_by_3_numbers(20)
False
```
This function can be further optimized by using the `all()` function to check if all numbers in a list are divisible by a given number. Here is an example:
```
def is_divisible_by_3_numbers(n):
    numbers = [i for i in range(1, n+1) if n % i == 0]
    return all(n % i == 0 for i in numbers)
```
This function first creates a list of numbers from 1 to `n+1` that are divisible by `n`. Then it uses the `all()` function to check if all numbers in the list are divisible by `n`. If all numbers are divisible, the function returns `True`, otherwise it returns `False`.</s>  ```
def is_divisible_by_3_numbers(n):
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        for j in range(i, n+1):
            if i * j == n:
                return True
    return False
```</s>  ```
def is_divisible_by_3_primes(n):
    primes = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29]
    for p in primes:
        if n % p == 0:
            return True
    return False
```
This function takes an integer `n` as input and checks if it can be divided by 3 prime numbers. The function first initializes a list of prime numbers, and then checks if `n` is divisible by each prime number in the list. If `n` is divisible by any prime number, the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```
print(is_divisible_by_3_primes(12)) # True
print(is_divisible_by_3_primes(15)) # False
```
This code uses a list of prime numbers to check if a given number can be divided by 3 prime numbers. The list of prime numbers is defined in the function, and the function checks if the input number `n` is divisible by each prime number in the list. If `n` is divisible by any prime number, the function returns `True`, otherwise it returns `False`.</s>  ```
def is_divisible_by_3_primes(n):
    prime_factors = []
    i = 2
    while len(prime_factors) < 3:
        if n % i == 0:
            prime_factors.append(i)
            n //= i
        i += 1
    return len(prime_factors) == 3
```
This function takes an integer `n` as input and returns `True` if `n` can be divided by 3 prime numbers, and `False` otherwise.

Here's an explanation of how the function works:

1. We initialize an empty list `prime_factors` to store the prime factors of `n`.
2. We loop through the numbers from 2 to the square root of `n`, checking if each number is a prime factor of `n`. If a prime factor is found, we add it to the `prime_factors` list and divide `n` by that factor.
3. We repeat step 2 until we have found 3 prime factors or we have reached the square root of `n`.
4. If we have found 3 prime factors, we return `True`. Otherwise, we return `False`.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```
>>> is_divisible_by_3_primes(12)
True
>>> is_divisible_by_3_primes(15)
False
>>> is_divisible_by_3_primes(36)
True
```
Note that this function assumes that the input `n` is a positive integer. If `n` is negative or zero, the function will return `False`.</s>  ```
def is_divisible_by_3_primes(n):
    primes = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29]
    for p in primes:
        if n % p == 0:
            return True
    return False
```</s>  ```
def is_divisible_by_three(n):
    if n % 3 == 0:
        return True
    else:
        return False
```
This function takes an integer `n` as input and returns `True` if it is divisible by 3 and `False` otherwise.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```
print(is_divisible_by_three(12))  # Output: True
print(is_divisible_by_three(15))  # Output: False
```
This function uses the modulo operator (`%`) to check if `n` is divisible by 3. If the result of the modulo operation is 0, then `n` is divisible by 3 and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, the function returns `False`.</s>  ```
def is_divisible_by_three_primes(n):
    primes = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29]
    for i in range(len(primes)):
        if n % primes[i] == 0:
            return True
    return False
```</s>  ```
def is_divisible_by_3(n):
    for i in range(1, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0 and n / i != i:
            return True
    return False
```
This function takes an integer `n` as input and returns `True` if it can be divided by 3 prime numbers, and `False` otherwise.

Here's how the function works:

1. We loop through all numbers from 1 to the square root of `n` (inclusive).
2. For each number `i`, we check if `n` is divisible by `i` and if `n/i` is not equal to `i`. If both conditions are true, we know that `n` can be divided by `i` and some other number, so we return `True`.
3. If the loop completes without finding any such number `i`, we return `False`.

Here are a few examples of how the function works:

* `is_divisible_by_3(12)` returns `True` because `12` can be divided by `2`, `3`, and `6`.
* `is_divisible_by_3(15)` returns `True` because `15` can be divided by `3`, `5`, and `15`.
* `is_divisible_by_3(24)` returns `False` because `24` can be divided by `2`, `3`, and `8`, but not by any three prime numbers.

Note that this function assumes that `n` is a positive integer. If `n` is negative, the function will return `False`.</s>  ```

        if n % p == 0:
            return True
