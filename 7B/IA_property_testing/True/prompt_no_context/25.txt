    [2, 2, 2]
    >>> factorize(25)
    [5, 5]
    >>> factorize(70)
    [2, 5, 7]

  Here is a test suite to test the future solution to the problem:

    from hypothesis import given, strategies

    def property_test(candidate_function) -> None:

        @given(strategies.integers(min_value=1, max_value=1000))
        def property_1(n):
            factors = candidate_function(n)
            assert len(factors) > 0
            assert all(isinstance(factor, int) for factor in factors)
            assert all(factor > 0 for factor in factors)
            assert all(factor in factors for factor in set(factors))
            assert all(factors[i] >= 1 for i in range(len(factors)))
            assert sum(factors) == n

        @given(strategies.integers(min_value=1000, max_value=10000))
        def property_2(n):
            factors = candidate_function(n)
            assert len(factors) == 2
            assert factors[0] * factors[1] == n

        @given(strategies.integers(min_value=10000, max_value=100000))
        def property_3(n):
            factors = candidate_function(n)
            assert len(factors) == 3
            assert factors[0] * factors[1] * factors[2] == n

        return [property_1, property_2, property_3]

This test suite includes three property tests:

1. property_1 tests the basic properties of the list of prime factors, such as the number of factors, the types of factors, and the multiplicity of each factor.
2. property_2 tests the specific case where the input number is a product of two prime factors.
3. property_3 tests the specific case where the input number is a product of three prime factors.

These property tests are designed to cover a wide range of inputs, from small integers to large integers, and to ensure that the future solution is robust and correct.</s>  ```

This function uses a loop to iterate over the divisors of the input number `n`. It checks if each divisor is a prime factor by dividing `n` by the divisor and checking if the result is 1. If it is not a prime factor, it increments the divisor by 1 and continues the loop. If it is a prime factor, it divides `n` by the divisor and appends the factor to a list. Finally, it returns the list of prime factors in the order from smallest to largest.</s>  ```

This code uses the fact that the prime factors of a number can be found by dividing it by the prime factors of its smallest factor. It uses a loop to iterate over the prime factors, and each time it finds a factor, it divides the number by that factor and adds it to the list of factors. The loop continues until the number is 1, at which point the list of factors is returned.</s>  ```
def factorize(n):
    factors = []
    i = 2
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i:
            i += 1
        else:
            n //= i
            factors.append(i)
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)
    return factors
```
This code uses a while loop to iterate through the factors of the given number, checking if each factor divides the number evenly. If a factor does divide the number evenly, it is removed from the number and added to the list of factors. The loop continues until the number is reduced to 1, at which point the remaining factor is added to the list. The resulting list of factors is returned.</s>  ```
def factorize(n):
    factors = []
    for i in range(1, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            factors.append(i)
            n = n // i
    return factors
```
This code uses a simple algorithm to find the prime factors of a given integer. It iterates from 1 to the square root of the input number and checks if the number is divisible by each number. If it is, the number is added to the list of factors and the input number is divided by that number. The process is repeated until the input number is 1, which means that all prime factors have been found. The list of factors is returned in the order from smallest to largest and each factor is listed the number of times it appears in the factorization of the input number.</s>  ```
def factorize(n):
    factors = []
    i = 2
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i:
            i += 1
        else:
            n //= i
            factors.append(i)
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)
    return factors
```
This code uses a while loop to iterate over the possible prime factors of the input number `n`. For each prime factor `i`, it checks if `n` is divisible by `i` using the modulo operator `%`. If it is divisible, it updates `n` to be the result of dividing `n` by `i` and appends `i` to the list `factors`. If `n` is not divisible by `i`, it increments `i` and continues the loop.

Once the loop is finished, if `n` is still greater than 1, it means that `n` is a prime factor that was not found in the loop. In this case, `n` is appended to the list `factors`.

The resulting list `factors` contains the prime factors of the input number in the order from smallest to largest, and each factor is listed the number of times it appears in the factorization.</s>
