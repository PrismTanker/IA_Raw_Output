-------------------
  Here is a test suite for the `fib` function:
```
{
    "test_fib_10": {
        "in": {
            "n": 10
        },
        "out": 55
    },
    "test_fib_1": {
        "in": {
            "n": 1
        },
        "out": 1
    },
    "test_fib_8": {
        "in": {
            "n": 8
        },
        "out": 21
    }
}
```
This test suite includes three tests, each of which tests the `fib` function with a different input value. The input values are specified in the `in` field, and the expected output values are specified in the `out` field. The test suite also includes a docstring that describes the function and its expected behavior.</s>  ```
def fib(n: int) -> int:
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
```</s>  ```
def fib(n: int) -> int:
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
```</s>  Here's a possible implementation of the `fib` function that satisfies the given constraints and passes the given test cases:
```
def fib(n: int) -> int:
    """Return n-th Fibonacci number."""
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
```
This implementation uses a recursive approach to calculate the n-th Fibonacci number. It first checks if `n` is less than or equal to 1, in which case the function returns `n` directly. Otherwise, it calls the `fib` function recursively with `n-1` and `n-2` as arguments, and returns the sum of the two results.

This implementation is efficient because it only calculates each Fibonacci number once and stores the results in the call stack. The time complexity is O(n), and the space complexity is O(1) because the function only uses a constant amount of memory to store the results of the recursive calls.</s>  ```

    if n <= 1:

def fib(n: int) -> int:
    a, b = 0, 1
    for _ in range(n):
        a, b = b, a + b
    return a

def fib(n: int) -> int:
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
```</s>  ```
def fib(n: int) -> int:
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
```</s>  ```
def fib(n: int) -> int:
    a, b = 0, 1
    for _ in range(n):
        a, b = b, a + b

```
This function uses a loop to iterate `n` times, and updates the values of `a` and `b` on each iteration according to the Fibonacci sequence. The function returns the final value of `a`, which is the `n`-th Fibonacci number.

Here's an explanation of how the function works:

1. The function starts with `a = 0` and `b = 1`, which are the first two Fibonacci numbers.
2. The loop iterates `n` times, with each iteration updating the values of `a` and `b` according to the Fibonacci sequence.
3. After the loop finishes, `a` contains the `n`-th Fibonacci number.
4. The function returns `a`, which is the `n`-th Fibonacci number.

For example, if `n = 5`, the loop will iterate 5 times, and `a` will be updated as follows:

* `a = 0` (initial value)
* `a = 1` (after first iteration)
* `a = 1` (after second iteration)
* `a = 2` (after third iteration)
* `a = 3` (after fourth iteration)
* `a = 5` (after fifth iteration)

Therefore, the function returns `a = 5`, which is the 5th Fibonacci number.</s>  ```
def fib(n: int) -> int:
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
```
This function uses a recursive approach to calculate the n-th Fibonacci number. It has a time complexity of O(2^n) and a space complexity of O(n).

To pass the test cases, we can use the following code:
```
assert fib(10) == 55
assert fib(1) == 1
assert fib(8) == 21
```
This will check that the function returns the correct values for the given input.</s>  ```
def fib(n: int) -> int:
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
